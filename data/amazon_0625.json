Ill break the review down into 2 parts. Ill start first with the hardware which should be helpful to anyone reading this and then the second part will specifically be about using Linux on it. Model is Dell i5379-5893GRY-PUS (Dell Inspiron 13" 2-in-1 touchscreen)Hardware:The build quality is nice. Despite being a plastic shell (instead of metal like the Inspiron 7000) it feels of good quality to the point of questioning if it is plastic. The finish is nice and doesn\'t appear to attract finger prints as much as glossier finishes. Its a good balance of enough weight to not feel cheap but not too much that its "heavy" for its size.Specs:* Intel i5-8250U (8th gen i5 with 4c/8t @ 15watt TDP)* Intel UHD Graphics 620 (integrated graphics, no dedicated GPU)* 8GB DDR4 2400mhz RAM (I think 1x8GB, will have to verify)* 256GB SATA SSD (Samsung PM871 from what I can tell, seems to be 2.5" 7mm not m.2)* 13" 1920x1080 IPS touchscreen (glossy, but not terrible)* Webcam supports Windows HelloPorts:2x USB 3.1 type-A1x USB 2.0 type-A1x HDMI (listed as 1.4)1x SD card reader1x Headphone/mic combo jackThe monitor has, in my opinion, pretty large bezels. At first I was disappointed by this but considering its ability to take a tablet form, this likely was done to give something to hold onto in tablet mode without touching the screen by accident. Otherwise its sharp and bright with decent viewing angles.The rear of the base has a short, somewhat wide vent to exhaust hot air out and does have an active fan however at its loudest it was negligible. I would have to focus on trying to hear it to notice. The upside is it should allow longer boost times on the CPU before throttling sets in.I found it a bit strange at first that the power and volume rocker are on the right side towards the front of the machine, but have since gotten used to it and figure it is also likely purposeful due to being able to use it like a tablet.The hinge between the base and monitor is sturdy and feels like it should last if treated well. I dont notice any wobbling while typing on a hard flat surface. The keyboard is ok but not great. I like the look of it and the backlighting can be plenty bright but the feel leaves a bit to be desired. The key presses seem to allow for pressure un-evenly on a key allowing one side to press further than the others which gives the sense that its not that sturdy. I would expect for the press to evenly push the key down but on this keyboard its a bit "mushy". For what its worth it appears to be the exact same keyboard as the Inspiron 13" 7000 series. On the flip side, the touch pad is pretty nice and I typically hate touchpads. This one is pretty large and the buttons (bottom right and left of the touchpad itself) are clicky.It doesnt look like there are any bay doors on the bottom to access the SSD or RAM and the batter is a built in job, not easily replaceable (if at all). It is unclear if the laptop has the 8GB included soldered in or in 1 of 2 ram slots. Its also unclear, but I expect that there is an empty 2nd ram slot (as most documentation seems to indicate it can be upgraded to 16GB by the user, just not how). I would imagine this would require removing the 8 or so screws on the bottom and maybe even using a pry tool to unsnap some plastic fasteners are the edges.For the price I was unable to find a laptop with everything I was looking to compete with this. I wanted a 13" or smaller 1080 touchscreen with an 8th gen CPU, 250GB+ SSD, 8GB+ DDR4 RAM. This was the best deal I could find at the time including that ($709). There are tradeoffs with that. Some of what you dont get are:* USB type-c* Thunderbolt 3* NVMe PCIe SSD* Metal body* Higher resolution screenI would say this is a great machine for anyone who wants something small and portable with decent specs and that doesnt require a ton of storage or super demanding tasks (CAD, 3d rendering, advanced photoshop, extrmely large databases/spreadsheets, etc.) or gaming.Linux:I am now using Linux at work alot and learn best by giving myself a practical purpose to do something. I wanted to entrench myself in Linux at home while having something that was modern, aesthetically pleasing, functional, practical and portable.Prior to getting this laptop I tried about about 10+ distros and decided that; a) I liked KDE Plasma as a desktop environment best and b) I like Manjaro Linux as a distro the most.I didnt get this to do development type work from or anything like that. This is meant to be my "daily driver", its what I will use every day to browse the web, check email, work on documents, watch media, do some minor photo/video editing, occasionally run a VM, etc.I downloaded the 17.0.6 Manjaro KDE ISO and setup an USB3 drive to install from. Booted from the drive and ran installer which took about 5-10 mins which is on par or maybe slightly faster than I would expect for a Win 10 install using the same hardware/specs.Out of the box all of the drivers where recognized and working. Here are a couple things I was worried about and can confirm all working:* Qualcomm AC Wifi (will add model later, not handy right now).* Qualcomm Bluetooth* Touchscreen* Keyboard Backlight* Webcam (both standard and infrared lol)* GPU drivers for Intel* Screen Brightness* SoundI have not yet found any part of the hardware not working as intended.Battery life appears to land me at about 6+ hours of steady use so I am very happy with it.Software wise, most things just work. I have had to, as with any linux distro, troubleshoot and work out some kinks but nothing I can even recall as worth mentioning.At the end of the day, this is the first time I have felt like I really own the computer. KDE especially allows a level of customization I could only dream of in Windows. This is coming from someone who not only likes Windows 10, but previously worked for a company for 6 years with MS partnership in which we provided remote and on site support for many of their products including Windows and Office. I\'ve developed professional course material and classes on Windows and taught the classes. I have defended Windows 10 fiercely at times. I have Windows Server 2016 Essentials at home and 3 other Windows 10 Pro computers on the domain with it.Why say all this about Windows? If someone like me can escape MS\'s strangle hold so can you. If you have considered moving to Linux this laptop is a great choice. However, dont take my word for it. Do your research, decide what distro and make sure it will work with whatever you install it on.EDIT (11/20/2017): So it appears the RAM and SSD can be upgraded. To do so requires removing the bottom of the laptop (roughly 8-10 screws and using a pry tool to unhinge the plastic tabs). Crucial shows upto 32GB (2x 16GB) RAM and guarantees compatibility. The SSD is a 2.5" SATA SSD 7mm height, so m.2 drives will NOT work and especially not PCIe/NVMe drives. I havent upgraded myself as I have no need to now.EDIT (01/02/2018): For anyone concerned with firmware/BIOS updates while using Linux I have done a Intel ME Firmware update and a BIOS update (1.3.2).For the Intel SA-00086 advisory and update Dell has a page listing all model affected with links to their updates (a link to it is posted on Intel\'s official page for the advisory). In this case I used a Windows to Go drive to boot to Windows 10 without altering the installed setup on my machine. I had to install drivers to Intels ME and reboot. I then ran the update from Windows to Go and then shutdown and booted back to Manjaro KDE to verify the results via the script Intel provides and it returned that the issue was patched. Be aware booting from Windows to Go wouldnt be needed if running Windows already.The BIOS is actually easier. You just put the BIOS update exe on a thumb drive and plug it in, boot and press F12 to get the boot menu, select BIOS update. Browse to the update file on the thumb drive and run the update. I havent seen any other firmware udpates related to the laptop but if there are others I will likely use a Windows to go drive to do so unless its specifically a BIOS update.**Upgraded machine!!!I have since purchase changed the wifi card and upgraded the RAM. I did this as the QCA6174 wifi card made by Qualcomm isnt exactly Linux friendly. It worked, but had 2 major issues. Slow SMB xfer and it would report wifi connecting at 6 MiB/s (incorrectly). I bought an Intel 8265 which is officially supported for use in Linux brand new for $20 and works perfectly.I figured while I had it open to add another stick of RAM so I bought an 8GB stick of crucial RAM\xc2\xa0Crucial 8GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD824A\xc2\xa0and it worked perfectly. To be honest the RAM upgrade wasnt even needed, but didnt want to break it open just to change the wifi card out. I considered an SSD upgrade as well, but I have like 200GB free of the 256GB so I am not exactly hurting for space.Also using this bluetooth mouse\xc2\xa0Logitech MX Anywhere 2 Wireless Mobile Mouse, Long Range Wireless Mouse with Hyper Scroll and Easy-Switch up to 3 Devices - Navy\xc2\xa0which plays very nicely connected via bluetooth. Latest stable Manjaro update even adds its battery status to the battery notification area! Really like this mouse.Would still highly recommend this laptop as I am sure it will serve me for years to come.', b'I like the laptop. Light wt, touch screen is excellent with good resolution, super quiet, SDD is amazing ( first time owning one). Fast enough with me running photoshop 2017. Overall good laptopCONS :- plastic build, could have been more sturdy- camera is ok ok. although tbh, no one really uses it these days- fan vent is located facing down, cant keep on the bed or on lap.', b'Light, feels sturdy. great screen. Has been a wonderful laptop so far. I spent a little more to get the solid state drive instead of a traditional disk. Less storage, but as one reviewer pointed out much lighter.', b"I'll be honest in saying I'm pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect to love this laptop as much as I did. After my tablet finally died I wanted something more versatile, and was thinking detachable keyboards would be the way to go. Saw this for the right price and decided to give it a shot. I'll never buy a 2-in-1 that can't swivel, ever. Can rotate it to any angle, adapts right away to tablet mode. It's a solid little powerhouse that can get a bit hot, but that's expected. Low storage isn't a huge issue. You can keep most things on another homegroup computer and keep the essentials local. Overall, great laptop for the price", b"I bought this laptop in December'17. My laptop started having issues a very few months after purchase (its still in warranty for quite some time). The laptop kept powering off and then not starting back-on (or no display) despite several tries and showed random behavior (i had to reset the OS too, losing all my data). Ultimately there came a time when the laptop shut off with no LEDs turning on and the laptop would not power-on no matter what. I had to FedEX ship my product to their Houston site after making a long customer delivery call. I got back my laptop in a week (with the motherboard replaced). However, ever since, it has battery issues (ie. the battery drops from 50%+ to 6% within a minute) making it impossible to work with the laptop unless connected to a power source. I have never seen a Dell laptop to have misbehaved so much, it really hinders all your work.", b"I bought this to replace a Dell XPS 13 that died suddenly.  While it doesn't have the fancy aluminum case, thin bezel and carbon fiber hand rest of the XPS, this Inspiron has a newer 8th generation processor, twice the SSD space, a touch screen and nice form flexibility.  I got it all set up and have found that it has a good looking screen, reasonably fast performance for a laptop and I like the ability to use it as a laptop or as a tablet.The performance and strong features for a price point of just $650, make this a very attractive choice if you are looking for a laptop of this size.", b'I absolutely love this product. It is light, and ideal for traveling with. Has a SSD with more than adequate storage for my needs, more than enough RAM, more than enough CPU speed/performance for everything I do. Battery life is ~ 7h. The network connectivity chip of this PC is a welcome change from my last PC (an HP which struggled with connecting to Wifi). This laptop immediately locks in to the nearest WiFi extender in my home - or any other WiFi I connect it to. LOVE the back-lit keyboard (my MUST-HAVE feature). Just the perfect PC for me. Very happy - No hesitation recommending this product.', b'Love this fast light weight computer. I use Corel draw on it and heavy duty embroidery software. Fast and easy']}

Those who are looking at upgrading a fairly old or not so powerful laptop and are looking to do a little more productivity, this is a great option.2. What do you get?Well you can probably read the description, however it\'s worth noting. You get an Intel i7 7500u CPU (dual core with 4 threads) 12gb DDR4 RAM, Nvidia 940mx GPU, a 256gb SSD, 15.6" 1080p screen, fingerprint reader, and a backlit keyboard.The reason I mention all of the feautures is because you would be hardpressed to find another laptop with these features for the same price. To my knowledge there is not laptop on the market for $800 with an i7, dedicated graphics, 12gb of RAM and an SSD. This is really one of the best values on the market right now.With all of that said, this isn\'t for everyone. If you want to do extensive gaming, this is not for you. Can it game? Yes, light gaming can be achieved, however it isn\'t marketed as a gaming laptop. Is this for someone who wants to do editing (video, audio, photos)? Yes, again light editing can be achieved.What blew me away with this computer is the speakers! They are fantastic! I usually use headphones and would consider myself somewhat picky with sound, and for laptop speakers these are really something great.This computer is really a middle of the pack all arounders dream. If you dabble in a little of this and a little of that but don\'t do anything professionally or extremely serious, this is really all you need.Also, everyone\'s experience is different. Some hate loud fans, and if this is pushed the fans will be audible. Some don\'t like that the backlit keyboard times out after 30 seconds of no use. These things really don\'t bother me.Lastly, the versatility of this laptop is really great. I\'ve bought tablets and sold them because I couldn\'t justify having a laptop and tablet, then bought tablets again because I missed the things I could do with them that I was missing on a laptop. This solved all of those issues except size. It\'s pretty big, which for some is a plus others its not.Overall, if you are looking at upgrading and don\'t want to spend $1,200-2,000 on a flagship model laptop this is a great option! I can\'t recommend this enough.', b"Better than Lenovo Flex 4. I originally purchased Lenovo Flex 4-15Inch 80VE000MUS. However, after a couple of weeks, the screen wobble, the 1/2 size right shift, and odd placement, sent me in search again. The Acer solves the keyboard issue, and the screen wobble is barely there, as I type this the Acer screen barely moves, the Lenovo screen is all over the place. The hinge on the Acer is stiffer, and wider and look more durable; and the balance between base and screen is better. The Lenovo wants to fall backwards. The Acer is fractionally lighter, on the scale. The trackpad is larger and works faster, smoother and QUIETER than the Flex 4. Acer is slightly thinner, but about 1/2 inch less wide, the rest of their footprints are basically identicalSame processor I7-7500U, 12GB Acer vs 8Gb on Flex Both are Full HD Screen, both 256SSD. Flex has Samsung passmark 4295 and Acer has HFS256 Passmark 3203. Frankly I can't tell the difference. Flex AMD Video Vs Acre Nvidia, again I can't tell the diff and I don't game.The screen on the Acer is MUCH brighter. I posted a photo of each at 50%. The Flex can hardly be seen outside, the Acer, much better, neither are good in direct sunlight. Speed, Acer seems slightly faster. Keyboard is firm and easy to type on layout on Acer is closer to a real KB. Both touchscreens work well, but the Flex 4 bounces much more. Wifi for both seem to hold the same 866 on 5ghz almost all over the house. Both boot really fast. Acer is missing Ethernet port, not something I use very often. Both have backlit KB, Sound on both is fairly decent, but I think the Acer may be slightly better. Neither has gotten hot in my lap, either during discharge or charging. Both are very quiet. Battery life seems good on both, but Acer is usually longer; Flex is 6-6.5, and Acer is 7-7.75 perhaps a bit better.  Neither has much bloatware, just the typical Lenovo, and Acer utilities and Office 365 trial; the rest is Windows 10 bloat.  Not giving Acer 5 stars because I have not owned more than a few days, If it stays fluid and reliable I would bump to 5 star, Flex 4 gets a 3 at best.All in All Acer wins for me. I like the gray steel color of the Acer better as well, and it feels solid to hold but not unwieldy.As with all things, you may have a different experience but I am very happy with the Acer R 15."]}

It's the ideal laptop for daily computing and entertainment.", b'For $499 the laptop is a bargain, but you should only buy if you you plan to add an SSD in the near future.Otherwise you cannot actually enjoy the strengths of this machine.So given the $499 price tagPros:+Light device with small footprint, far more portable than the usual 15.6 laptops+Very good IPS matte FHD panel, zero reflections, almost zero light bleed, average brightness. You cannot find such display in laptops up to $750+The colour is a beautiful grey and not purple as reviewed by other users+Excellent specs with proper  upgradeability, ( free m2 slot , memory can be increased compared to models with soldered modules)+fingerprint sensor is accurateCons-No computer is 2017 should be shipped with an HDD. This HDD makes the machine really slow,Until the first round of boots/restarts and updates is competed you will think that you have bought a entry level celeron. The disk works full load and cannot cope, (it is fine for very basic tasks but you did not buy an 8250u for basic tasks).-Keyboard is not that good, i fell that there is uneven uniformity in the button press and travel, and definitely some flex,-power button next to delete button ? So you end up switch off while typing, (same button arrangement in many small form factor laptops.-Caps lock without a led notification, not so clever,Now the ssd part,I got a Crucial mx300 m.2 ssd it comes with m2 crews and free acronis clone softwareInstallation needs patience and some proper tools.1.carefully remove all screws including the 2x under the rear rubber pads2. get a PLASTIC prying tool or a thin guitar pick and carefully lift the cover starting from an edge near one of the corners, do not use screwdriver or knife, you will damage the plastic,3. with the help of your plastic tool unclip one be one all the platic clips,4.remove cover and install the m2 ssd (face down for crucial) no extra force to snap in5. get back the cover and do all the screws (3 different types of screws)6 power  the device pressing constantly F2 to enter bios, see that your ssd has been identified,7 download the cloning software, acronis, macrium or other. Clone the disks (automated step by step process)8 enter bios (F2 and power) and select m2 as first boot device9 no trouble with windows licence, you can wipe the HDD via "disk managmenet10 completely delete all the partitions of old HDD use Diskpart applications for the command line,now you have a proper  FAST machine with an extra 1TB storage drive, it is 5x faster in nominal terms but it feels 50x times faster in reality.', b'For the price I paid, this laptop can\'t be beat.  I applied for an Amazon Store Card while purchasing, which gave me a $40 instant credit, further knocking down the price.This laptop is small and thin for a 15.6" screen (fits in my 14" laptop sleeve), very light (only 3.7 lbs), and fast (8th gen i5 and 8 GB RAM).  As others have said, the only downside is the slow 5400 RPM 1 TB hard drive.  As far as that goes, I have a trick to get around it if you\'re planning to install an SSD.  Alternatively, I also have advice if you\'re planning to stick with the included hard drive.  Here it goes.If you\'re planning to upgrade to an SSD drive and already have the SSD drive in hand, then do this to avoid the slow hard drive headaches:1. Boot up the new laptop for the 1st time.2. While activating Windows, DO NOT connect to your WiFi.3. After Windows fully starts up, install disk cloning software (Macrium Reflect, Acronis, etc.) from a USB flash drive. You can\'t download the disk cloning software because you are not connected to WiFi.4. Shut down the laptop, open it up, and install your SSD drive.5. Turn on the laptop again. Use the disk cloning software to clone the hard drive onto your SSD drive.6. Turn off the laptop.  At this point you have a choice. You can either boot into the BIOS to set your new SSD drive as the default boot drive while keeping the old hard drive installed, or you can just remove the old hard drive to force the laptop to boot off the new SSD.7. Turn on the laptop and admire how awesomely fast it starts up from the lightning quick SSD!  :-)8. Now you can finally connect to your WiFi network and let Windows download and install all it\'s updates and security patches.The reason I recommend doing this is because you don\'t want to let Windows try to download and install hundreds of MB\'s of updates and patches while running off the dog slow 1 TB hard drive.  That would take a very long, long time.  And the slow hard drive will be at 100% disk utilization for hours or days while it\'s trying to download and install all these Windows updates.  As other people have said, the laptop will seem to freeze and be unresponsive during this time.  But by upgrading to an SSD drive BEFORE letting the laptop download and install Windows updates, the fast SSD will make this process go A LOT FASTER.And my tip for those people who don\'t plan to install an SSD drive and just keep using the included 1 TB hard drive:1. After booting up the laptop for the 1st time, activate Windows, and connect to your WiFi.2. Then leave the laptop on for a day or two and don\'t try to use it.  Why?  Because people have said it can take up to 2 days for the laptop to download and install all the Windows updates.  Trying to use it during this time, with the hard drive utilization pegged at 100%, would be a exercise in frustration.3. Then finally, after all the Windows updates have been downloaded and installed, reboot the laptop and use it as you wish.  The laptop should be fairly speedy now after the initial slowness from the updates.  Enjoy!', b"I got this laptop an it took me a little to figure out the layout and disassembly of the back cover. Be careful with the rubber bumpers there are 2 screws underneath. The M.2 slot is SATA 3 (Cheap Bastards) not mvne. Be careful how you insert the SSD drive. The 6 pin is on the right side of the slot. The screws on the back are different sizes so mark them where they belong. For a clean install,  start the laptop with the original OS and let it register to Microsoft. Once is register as digital license wiped and install the new Fall creators OS. Don't use any sharp metal to pray the back cover it will break. I use a Crucial SSD and is working excellent. I put the link. Please don't mine mi spelling I don't give a human @ss. I put some pics for all you to check the location and installation of the SSD. Enjoy\xc2\xa0Crucial MX300 275GB M.2 (2280) Internal Solid State Drive - CT275MX300SSD4"]}

I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I love this machine. I have hhr combined SSD and 1 TB HD. I did my research on the specs and this is the best value I could find for the money.The machine booted up windows 10 in exactly 10 seconds!  After I set up my fingerprint scan it does the fast and easy boot up every time. I am surprised by how fat it is.So far it's completely silent. No fan noise no HDD boot up noise,  nada.I would suggest that you see the YouTube reviews of the machine, the keyboard is a bit plain and the build is plastic, but for me it is just fine.I love that I can upgrade it and  both the memory and the SSD and this will be by far the best machine I've ever owned.  I am happy with this purchase, and I think you will too.", b"Overall Grade: C (For Me, read Consideration)Great For: Travel, light duty work, lightweight, headphone usersPros:Light Light Light (like a spiral notebook light)compact chargerBattery is all day amazingscreen is amazingthin bezels allow for a compact frameram upgrade AvailableWith SSD Lightning fast start upHard Drive upgrade availableCons:Plastic Build/ Durability (for Me read below)Keyboard FlexNo Back Light KeyboardAudioHeatperformance is mediocreOverall this is a good system for the price and I do recommend the SSD for the price.  But my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises, both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk.  Even when I was watching YouTube or streaming Netflix this thing kicked up immediately, even with low settings and the battery saver mode on. The performance for the build seems lacking and struggled with 3 explorer windows open and one excel file while I was doing research and nothing in the background.  Which you should be able to run with an I-5, I could accept this if it was an M3 or bottom of the bucket system but not with this.Consideration: If you are of average frame and strength then this build will be perfect and the keyboard flex and body is the perfect fit between lightweight and rigidity.  My friends, both female and male, are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking.  Please take in consideration that I stand at 6' x 255 and have a combined total of 1600 + on the big three lifts in power lifting so I am large and strong.  This adds to my need for a strong system and willing to sacrifice some weight for strength.  Also I do a lot of research as well as build systems so this may be my over expectations kicking in just a tad, if you are coming from only using low end systems this is probably a half grade up (C+ or B) systemBest For: If you are looking for a travel laptop and are planning on doing light work this is an amazing buy for the price.  Not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design.  Even with the fan and heat if you use a cool mat on your lap you will be find especially with the screen being amazing for the price.  And with all the ports available it is hard to go wrong.For the price it is an amazing starting point and hard to beat especially with such an amazing brand such as ASUS.  Always loved ASUS and they build amazing machines.  Oh and this is a BEAUTIFUL machine and the lid is amazing.  I am just going to save for a step up.  If you can save for 750 - 800 I would recommend going up a bit in the ASUS line.", b'Great great great laptop. Love it, strong upgrade from my aging Core i3. I followed the popular recommendations to purchase the 128GB SSD along with the 1TB hard drive. Very fast, nice screen, like the fingerprint sensor. Here are the shortcomings that keep it from a 5.1) Power key is located within the keyboard up at the top right corner. It is adjacent to the often used Delete, Backspace, and Home keys. Really? This passed their use case criteria? I often miss the Delete or Backspace keys and am accidentally putting my laptop into sleep. Several decades of best practices in designing laptops has led to this? Sigh. Deep. Sigh. Found the workaround at a CNET article.  Since Amazon won\'t allow URL\'s in reviews, just Google "Asus Vivobook power button" and it will be the first link.2) Keyboard is not backlit. This should be a simple feature addition that is minor in terms of cost. Merely an LED and a light tube. Would have been worth a few extra buck were this to be included in their bill of materials.3) No Ethernet port. Sometimes it\'s necessary to be hardwired into a router to configure things.', b'This computer is fantastic.  I did a lot of researching looking for laptops in varying sizes (13.3, 15.6, 17.3).  I was looking for an SSD and i5 8th gen CPU, and at a great price.  After arrival this computer easily beat my expectations.  The computer is super fast (thanks SSD) and has no problem running large excel spreadsheets and access files.  I looked at more expensive laptops and almost pulled the trigger on the $750 Zenbook.  I\'m more than happy with this "Cheaper" alternative that all of my needs.  SSD, 8th gen i5 CPU..  Laptop is super light and slim too which makes it ultra portable']}

Of course it\'s limited in many, many ways, but that\'s the whole point of buying a Chromebook. I\'ve been using this device for a little over half a semester in college for in class note taking, group work, etc. I use my desktop for any heavy duty stuff. It\'s worth noting that I rollerblade to classes, so I was looking for something as light as possible and as durable as possible.Pros:Very sturdy - I\'ve dropped it many times and the worst that has happened is the rubber edging will have to be popped back into place. Simple as that and it feels totally firm and solid once it\'s back in place. It\'s great to not have to treat your laptop like the slightest bump could damage it.Fantastic keyboard - The keyboard has a nice "chunk" with each keystroke. The keys have enough travel and require enough force to avoid accidental keystrokes and typing feels great, even satisfying.Great battery life - I never bring my charger with me anymore, no matter how long I expect to be out.Good sunlight readability -  The screen does a pretty fine job of reducing strong glare.Cons:Weight - Though it\'s not particularly heavy for a Chromebook, its weight is a significant addition to my backpack. At just over two pounds, however, it\'s not a huge compromise in return for how durable this machine is.Sometime slow - As you\'d expect. But honestly Chrome does a good enough job of managing resources that I only notice severe lag when opening presentations with many elements in them.All in all, this Chromebook has exceeded my expectations!', b'This is a very solid feeling unit, unlike many inexpensive Chromebooks. All the reviews are spot on about performance and battery life. I take exception to the comments about this unit (or any Chromebook) being "limited." Google "install Ubuntu on Chromebook" and follow the instructions, and you will have a fully functional Linux computer. Install LibreOffice for your office suite, Gimp for photo editing, Audacity for audio recording and editing, and any other Linux applications you want. Put a 64 GB SD card in the slot for all your data. You will have a computer that is more secure than any Windows computer, costs a small fraction of any Mac computer, and can do pretty much anything you want. The world of Linux software is amazing, and it is all free, OK, so it can\'t manage your iPhone, but it can do darn near anything else. All for under $200. I do not see myself going back to Windows or Mac ever.', b'49 year old 3D designer here. I was looking for a light weight solution to get me out of my office when I just needed to use the internet, google docs etc. Figured for $200 it would just be a nice little cheap toy. This thing is pretty amazing. Nice keyboard, decent screen, great webcam (to use mostly with Hangouts) good speakers  and its really fast. I watched about 4 hours of videos on battery and it only went down to 79% full. Solid unit, very happy with purchase.', b'Great little device for writing.  I am a writer and I needed something simple without a lot of bells and whistles and whips and chains :)  This little Chromebook netbook is awesome for traveling.  It takes a little bit to get used to Chrome\'s operating system, but once you do you\'ll discover some very nice proprietary advantages.A small\xe2\x80\x94but nice thing\xe2\x80\x94is not having to right click any more; instead, you simply tap with two fingers for word corrections.  This is great for someone like me who writes a lot and needs to have a simplified workflow.The battery is long lasting and the keyboard is a perfect size, even for someone as big as I am. 6\'3" 300.Because I use google docs to write with, this seemed a natural step. Chromebook seamlessly integrates Google Docs, and most other important apps into the framework of the little machine, so it\'s very easy to use and get started. The offline stuff is very useful too as I\'m not always in a place where there\'s wifi and I can still work on my books.Another nice feature is how light it is.  My wife bought a laptop a couple years ago and she would share it with me (begrudgingly) and I always hated working on it because it was big, heavy, and clunky.  This little Chromebook weighs next to nothing and is easy to tote around.All in all, I\'d give this 10 stars if I could\xe2\x80\x94especially considering the price.Disclaimer - shameless self-promoting in the photo :)', b'it doesnt have a caps lock button but thats okay because i probably shouldnt be yelling at people over the internet anyway']}

There are a lot of variants on this particular computer. Came with 8gigs of ram. For those wondering It's a dual core with two virtual cores, performance of a quad core. came with 128gig ssd and dvd-rom drive. Which if you buy a hdd caddy you can then put another upgrade either ssd or hdd. This computer boots to a fully loaded win10 within 30 seconds. Very fast. No Bluetooth but has a wifi on and off switch on the side. Intel 3000 graphics. Not very fast but runs a lot games. Crysis at low settings was playable but not worth playing. asphalt 8 is very smooth on the windows store. Using it right now on battery power to type this. The battery by the way last for hours. I use this mostly to render hdr files with photomatix and photoshop when i'm out of town to save some time. I didn't realize it would do it twice as fast as my desktop! I haven't actually been using my desktop since I got a wireless mouse and laptop stand. Has hdmi out as well and works great on either a monitor or big tv without any problems, does drain the battery though so you might want to keep it plugged in if you do that. Comes with a standard size SD card reader in the front. The speakers are actually pretty good for a laptop too, they don't sound like cardboard. There are also 3 usb 2.0 ports, no 3.0 but you can get an upgrade cady for that if you need it. Has a vga out as well. One cool thing I like is you can hold down the FN button and push up or down on the arrow pad to dim or brighten the screen. Very usefull for photoshopping on the go so you can double check around the picture then darken to save battery, I may not even worry about battery power since it last so long, just an old habit I suppose. For around 200 bucks you can't beat this. Net books are about the same price but are so much more limited to what you can do software wize.", b'The Latitude line is Dell\'s no-nonsense, business class computer - and this model keeps with the tradition.  It\'s built like a tank, so if today\'s trendy, thin-as-a-legal-pad forma factor is what you want, look elsewhere.  On the other hand, if running productivity software on a machine that\'s built for the purpose is what you need, this is a perfect match.  My model is 8g RAM, and a 128g SSD, so I get no "moving parts" to rattle or crash in my briefcase.  Since I live on a cloud drive, that\'s more than enough space for a full install of MS Office, Win10 Pro and a couple vertical-market apps I use.  Video game fans would pooh-pooh the graphics, but they were made for productivity apps and are PERFECTLY fine for that.  In short, for the price of a new Winbook, this gives me ten times the functionality for the price of a few more ounces in  my briefcase.  Seller is also VERY responsive - the charger that came with the box DID work, but at a "trickle" rate.  Before I even had time to ask, they replaced it.  Stellar service!', b'What\'s to love:- Super Fast SSD hard drive (Boots is less than 30 seconds & quick program loads)- WiFi switch for those connected to pay-as-you-go data plan or concerned about security / hackers. (Turn WiFi off when not using Internet)- Audio up / down buttons, and a mute button right on the keyboard! (Great if you need to take a phone call)- Two key brightness and dim adjustment (if it works for you)- Caps Lock indicator light is right on the Caps Lock key!- Heavy duty construction (Great for those that are rough with their laptop)- The priceWhat\'s not to love:- This laptop was made in 2011, so it\'s already 7 years old (in 2018)- Very small 128 GB hard drive only has 90 GB free when you receive it- This laptop is about 6 lbs. That\'s quite heavy for an everyday carry- It\'s refurbished- The price fluctuates often (use a 3rd party to track the price)What\'s missing:- No modem- No camera or microphone- No fingerprint reader- No back lit keyboard- No Blu-Ray- No touchscreenMine came with:- 8 GB DDR3-1333MHz SDRAM- Intel Core i5-2520M, 2.50GHz, with 3MB Cache 2.5 Ghz (Dual Core)- 128 GB SSD hard drive (You will LOVE the speed of this drive!)- Intel HD Graphics 3000 card with 1336x768 max resolution (This will not show HD movies in max 1080p resolution)- 14.0" Anti-Glare LED-backlit screen- WiFi 802.11a/g/n 2X2 (it can send and receive on two antennae at once)- Bluetooth- TouchPad with 2 buttons as well as a pointing stick (i.e. TrackStick) with 3 buttons- 8X DVD Player- 6-Cell (60WH) Lithium Ion Battery- 65W AC Adapter (~7 ft long)Ports:- HDMI out port (Great for adding a second monitor or playing DVDs on a a large screen TV)- VGA out port (for very old analog screens and TV connections)- Headphone Jack (Most people will probably use Bluetooth)- RJ45 Internet port (If you prefer a wired connection to the Internet)- Docking port (For use with a Dell PR03X Port Replicator docking station )- 3 USB 2 ports: 1 on the left and 2 on the right (There are no USB 3 ports)- Express Card slot (Not compatible with PCMCIA, but you could use it to add USB 3 ports)- SD Card slot (supports SD, SDHC and SDXC)- SmartCard reader (This is for business / IT use - most people will never use this)Included OS & software:- Windows 10 Professional for Refurbished Computers- Free Trial of Office 365 ($99.99 a year or $9.99 a month if you want to keep it.)- VLC Media Player- Acrobat Reader DCProblems I had from day 1:- SD port did not recognize my SD cards. I ended up having to download drivers from Dell. (Big headache)- AC adapter transform makes an annoying ticking sound sometimes- Fn key when used in conjunction with the up and down arrows does not brighten or dim the screen- Fn key when used in conjunction with the Num Lock(F2) does not engage the Num Lock section of the keyboard', b"Performs much better than I expected.

It can only connect via a Wi-Fi network connection.  It also has trouble loading Windows updates.  But it's a slim, light and attractive laptop that works well with my HP desktop and printer.", b"Beautifully designed laptop. The only (a very major) issue with this laptop is the storage space.  The laptop comes with 32G and with everything right out of the box sums up to about 20G of memory taken.  Installed Microsoft Office leaving about 7G of memory left.  Within a day, Windows 10 wanted to update the version and tries to download over 10G of temporary data.  The laptop refuse to update because of the lack of space and I was unable to create more space.  Seems worthless if it can't even update and that's before I even used it for anything.  Returned this item.", b'I love this laptop! I use it for school work and it gets the job done.

Excellent product... seller highly recommended. Just tell you to remember that before buying you should check the article's description to make sure if the item is what you expect.Of course this laptop does not have enough memory (nevertheless, you can add an extra memory card).But if you are looking for laptop in which you can type at the bus, or any cramped place, this is the best...I'm very happy with my purchase... I sincerely recommend you to buy from this seller..!! :-) :-) :-)\xc2\xab\xc2\xab\xc2\xab\xc2\xab Item is perfect for written tasks, or any task that do not require to much memory, is perfect for Word, Excel, power point... and others...\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb\xc2\xbb", b"Very good laptop considering the price. For someone who only needs Office and Internet tasks, it works perfectly fine and is quite quick. I recommend an SD card for storing documents, as the internal storage is very limited at only 32GB. I also recommend entirely disabling the Windows Update service as it's entirely possible to fill the drive just with updates alone. Given these limitations, it's a great budget machine.", b"Bought it for my niece for her freshman year at college. She uses it often and hasn't had any problems with it.", b'Got this laptop today. So far I love it. It\'s lightweight and easy to navigate. The only thing about it that I really hate is the SD card slot. The computer only comes with 4GB of memory so an SD card is necessary for added memory. But the card doesn\'t "click" into the slot like most I have encountered. It just slides in and out and isn\'t secure at all. It hangs out of the slot partially. I got the card to store all apps and programs on and now I\'m scared it\'s going to fall out and get lost. If I tip the laptop on it\'s side so the SD slot is facing the ground, all it takes is a good shake to dislodge the card. Please keep this in mind if you are like me and plan on storing everything on a SD card.', b'Was great until it died less than 3 months later']}

I have to admit that I initially wanted the Dell 7577, though it was not available for international shipping and cost 300$ more in my country, and the gl503 was way to expensive. Still Eventually i decided to go, even bet on this one since there weren't any reviews on it. I had this laptop over two weeks, adequate time for a review.Package was intact and in order, also got the warranty document and guide. No dead pixels on the screen to my surprise, no defects can be seen or any other damages. The matte finish is absolutely stunning, feels great very slick looking, doesn't at all look like a gamer laptop which in my opinion is a big plus. The screen has a flex to it but the keyboard part of the laptop is pretty rigid, it's not the best build but  there has to some compromises to match the price point. Nice quality camera and very nice speakers. The keyboard feels really good, very comfortable to type, touchpad got a very smooth feeling to it, responds very well nice to use. The Screen is awesome, great display even from difficult angles. The laptop comes only with a power button unlike asus rog series that has additional buttons for gamer features. The selection of ports is ok, 3 usb 3 an one sd card, in my case i don't need more than that so it doesn't bother me.This machine packs an insane hardware for it's size, weight and thickness, i7 7700hk cpu, 1060 3g, 16 gb, 128 ssd 3 + 1tb 5400rpm. Still impressive that they fit everything in this laptop. This is an absolute game crusher, tested it on shadow of war, wolfenstein ii the new colossus and overwatch:Shadow of war on ultra: 45-65 fpsWolfenstein ii the new colossus on ultra: 75-95 fpsOverwatch on epic: 100-120 fps.Overall very very impressive.Now for the not so good part. The minor issues: the usb ports seem to be too rigid, you have to use some force to take out a device out of the port, though in time it seems to get a bit easier, i hope it won't be worn out eventually. In addition the num lk is annoying, there is no indicator if it's on or off. Furthermore, the fans are really really loud under heavy load, but this is not to big of a deal since i always play with earphones. This is the successor to the fx502, that laptop had to big issues: screen and heating. The screen on the fx503 is ips so no problem with that but to my disappointment the big heating problem is still alive. Since asus packed this heavy duty hardware in this thin laptop they had to compromise, so the cooling system is not good at all, really bad. While gaming on high settings the temps were really high, just to note the the gpu handle itself very well and it's on usually 69-75 C, the problem is the cpu. under heavy load it got to 96 C!!! really bad. Took me a while to find a trick to lower the temps, a good on is to go to window's advanced power options and to lower the max cpu usage to 99% from 100% so the cpu won't go to turbo mode, that takes down a couple of degrees which i strongly recommend to people who buy this to do this option even with a cooling pad, performance won't be effected. Another method is to elevate the laptop so there would be an airflow between the surface and the laptop. Despite those methods the temps are still to high for the cpu, were about high 80's under max load. there is no escape from buying a cooling pad, actually with this laptop the cooling pad does a great job because of the laptop's ventilation at the bottom that exposes the gpu and the cpu cooling system, it took down a whopping -15+ C which is a lot, now under max load it's usually around mid 70's up to 80 as it should be.I would have given this product a 4 star if it wasn't for the cooling pad, with it this laptop is a beast that will last for a while so my final rating is 4.5, so if you do not mind the cooling pad this is a great option for the average gamer. Overall awesome laptop and very portable.**EDIT: Strongly recommend (at your own discretion -it's quite safe just watch a youtube guide for XTU) to undervolt the cpu, will do wonders to temps and performance.", b"Well, I purchased this gaming laptop for my son. At first he thought I got the wrong one, but after I showed him all the stats on it he changed his mind and is now extremely happy with it.  Great graphics and fantastic sound quality.  This has more bells and whistles then our desk top computer and way more memory.  I'm happy that I found this on Amazon, because it's a way better price then the exact one at BestBuy!!! Bought it Thursday and had it in my hands on Saturday!!! \xf0\x9f\x98\x80", b'This laptop is a beast for the price.Pros.-design is simple and not too flashy. Its plastic though but the brushed look makes it look alright-Audio is loud and clear. A little cracking at full volume but maybe its from the audio quality-keyboard is nice although the arrow keys are kinda out of place but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really bother me since I don\xe2\x80\x99t use it.-graphics card. This thing packs a 1060 gtx but its only 3gb but thats all you really need at this price budget.Cons-Colors are not that vivid and screen might be a little dim but its still good.Overall 4.5/5 for great 60fps gaming at high-ultra quality if you turn off some settings to not maximize your vram.(Is it better than the Acer predator and Helios 300 on sale in Amazon? Yes and No. this has 1tb extra so you\xe2\x80\x99re already winning. The design of the acer is flashier but that\xe2\x80\x99s really subjective to what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for. The acer has 6gb so acer wins with that but the dim screen and the heating issue with the acer just makes it less desirable for me.)', b"Overall, this is a great budget laptop for anyone who wants a powerful rig on the go. Out of the box, it will perform great and work as advertised. The heatsink and cooling are actually very impressive for the compact size. Great ventilation grills on the bottom, easily upgradeable RAM, M.2, and HDD. Good screen with a great resolution for a 15.6in along with plenty of HDD space for games, movies, music, etc.I made this purchase for work, music production, djing, and on the road gaming. I really appreciate that it's not super over the top looking like other gaming laptops. Very minimalist and professional looking.In the weeks I've owned this model there are only three things I have found to dislike about this laptop which is listed below.1. Loud cooling fans! This laptop will let you know that the fans are going at 100%. I've only experienced this while putting the CPU/GPU under heavy load while gaming. If your wearing headphones or a headset you won't be able to hear it but I definitely wouldn't game at the library.2. It has a very solid build quality, however, a lot of the materials are plastics. Very durable plastics but plastics none the less. -1 for plastic...3. The CPU temps I have seen reach up to a peak 96C under heavy use while gaming. Had to do a few things to help this issue as 96C is very hot for a CPU.The best way to remedy this problem is to turn off Intel's turbo boost to keep the CPU at 2.80 GHz which helps stabilize the temperature. (Very easy to do in Windows power options.)You may also purchase a laptop cooling pad. Note that this will only bring down temps by 4-6C degrees overall.--- This final and completely OPTIONAL remedy that will help reduce temperatures significantly However it requires advanced technical skills and may void the manufactures warranty. ---Replacing the manufactures thermal paste with something that performs better. (***AGAIN please note that replacing the thermal paste may VOID your warranty. Only perform this if you have the technical knowledge, understanding, and are willing to void the warranty. I am not responsable if you attempt this and brick your computer***)Making all of the changes listed above will improve the laptops thermal regulation significantly and reduce CPU temperatures from peaks of +/-96C to +/-70C under heavy load. With the GPU hitting the highest temperature of +/-75C as well. I have yet to see temperatures higher than 75C on either chip since performing the steps above.If you do not wish to peform the thermal paste swap and void your warranty, which is completely understandable. You'll be looking at peak heavy gaming load temperatures of +/- 83C with just a laptop cooling pad and Intel's turbo boost turned off through Windows power settings.I hope this review was helpful and brought insights to some of the very few flaws I've found, along with ways to troubleshoot them. If you want a budget powerhouse laptop that isn't too flashy or over the top. I'd say you can't go wrong with this impressive machine from ASUS. Especially if you put a little TLC into it should last a long time.", b'This laptop is a beast. Run new Design and 3d programs without troubles. It\xe2\x80\x99s very fast and the size and weight are cool. I recommend it!']}

I\xe2\x80\x99m an average joe and don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to gain from this review other than a place to put my thoughts.My previous laptop specs were a Toshiba 2.1 ghz, 4 GB ram, 500gb hard drive. I purchased it back in 2013. I spent maybe 350$ on it back in the day. It had slow-down due to years of use, and the fan had become loud. It\xe2\x80\x99s still functional, and served it\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, but it was time to upgrade and move on.Spending a little more to double my ram, I decided on this HP product. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ve had problems with HP back in 2009 with a motherboard crash 1 month after the warranty expired. I learned my lesson to never buy a laptop over $500+ again. Given that experience I was hesitant to buy this product. Enjoying the sleek design, multitude of gizmo\xe2\x80\x99s, and comparatively not finding a better buy for the price - I took the plunge.Before I go further, you should know I will be using my product for business via the internet and casual gaming. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you much about having multiple apps open at the same time given that might demand a heavy load (I.e. quick-books, excel, adobe editor, pro-tools, streaming services and a game etc etc). If you\xe2\x80\x99re pushing that many things at once, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to have a couple CPU\xe2\x80\x99s.Right off the bat, I noticed that the product was made in China, and it was sent in to be refurbished by a gentleman in Kentucky. The refurbished risk was a chance, but really, in this day you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a pretty advanced package for the price.About the exterior;It\xe2\x80\x99s nice. Has a well thought out and put together frame. The F1-F12 keys are easy to use for adjusting brightness or quickly modifying the volume. The only problem I\xe2\x80\x99m having is that the up,down arrow keys are small. In efforts to have a sleek design, they minimized the up,down key area. I have average man hands, so it takes some time to get used to.The outside of the laptop smudges easily with your naturally oily fingers. Will have to pick up a 20$ peripheral case to compensate and not look like the rag-o-muffin at the coffee shop.Everything else is as you would expect from a laptop. Touch-screen is great for apps/games like Hearth-Stone, exhaust fan and power cord input are reasonable. The charge cord has a 3 prong wall input. As a minor annoyance, I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer the two prong without the 3rd input due to extension cords strategically placed near my couch, but hey, I\xe2\x80\x99ll upgrade and deal with it.It\xe2\x80\x99s nice having two usb\xe2\x80\x99s on opposite sides of the laptop - one right side, and two on the left.Even though your computer has Bluetooth functionality, it also helps having a headphone input. Luckily good-guy HP included one. (*cough* Apple Iphone 7 fail)Because the laptop has a sturdy but light compact gathering, you can slightly hear a bit of the inner workings. The processor has a slight \xe2\x80\x9cthinking\xe2\x80\x9d sound. The fan is quiet and subtle. As I record voice-overs, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the sound is loud enough to interfere. The fan being located on the side of the product also helps keep things cool when it\xe2\x80\x99s on your lap.The display is nice and feels high quality. Colors are crisp, and the framing of the screen is appropriate. When going from a dark to light screen, there's a slight adjustment time to allocate brightness. Not really anything to complain about, but more just something slightly different. (It\xe2\x80\x99s probably adjusting for dark to light pixels as not to shock or hurt your eyes. No idea if you can turn this on or off, but really, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to complain about).Power on - What\xe2\x80\x99s goin on?Initial set-up takes about 30 minutes with an internet connection. It will download a 4-6 gb WIndows 10 update in the background once it\xe2\x80\x99s up.I\xe2\x80\x99d say it takes 15 seconds to get to the Window\xe2\x80\x99s 10 log in screen, 15 more seconds to get fully up, and functional with everything running coming in at a combined 45 seconds.Toshiba is notorious for throwing too much crap onto your computer you\xe2\x80\x99ll never need. Luckily HP gives you the pork and beans with this product. Also, during Windows 10 setup, I found myself custom setting things up as to turn off minor annoyances like Cortana or notifications.The only thing I wish would have been included were a better notepad application. I ended up downloading google docs straight to my computer, so now I have a word-pad app.I downloaded audacity to get an idea on the integrated microphone quality. I noticed the app ran very smooth. You can easily hop in an out of it, and I had Hearth-Stone running at the same time. The muli-tasking on this computer is nice.The onboard mic is average. It can do the job, and tracks appropriately, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to use it for anything other than Skype, I\xe2\x80\x99d say pick up a 50$ usb mic.The onboard camera is nice. It\xe2\x80\x99s tracking rate was actually better than I thought it\xe2\x80\x99d be. It can definitely get the job done for a skype situation. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to use it as a main source for tracking YouTube videos, I\xe2\x80\x99d say invest in a decent camera/audio arrangement.Video Games/Media -I played Hearthstone earlier today, and I must say I was very impressed. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t experience any slow-down even with multiple apps open. Ok, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not the most hard-core game out there, but the touch-pad function was nice.The speakers are great. I was really impressed with the level of not-suckage it contained. I usually run the speakers at 80% so they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep their life, and won\xe2\x80\x99t peak. Even so, it has a lot of amperage, and could set the mood to any room.Skyrim -Ok, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s an older game, but Steam has a great modding community that has helped keep this game up to date and graphically relevant. I was able to run this game on Medium Settings. Under these settings it ran smooth, and was able to include depth of field and other effects such as fog and shadows. Under High settings I did receive significant slow-down. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for something to run the latest in gaming, I\xe2\x80\x99d say go for a better laptop.But for me, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s ok. I plan to play the games I can\xe2\x80\x99t get on PS4 via PC. I think it will have no problems running the latest Counter-Strike, Undertale, or Diablo 3.The Final Verdict -Overall, for this day and age, and for the price, I\xe2\x80\x99d say you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a very solid piece of hardware. I\xe2\x80\x99d rate it maybe an 8.3/10 - give or take a few points for my minor annoyances, or my old habitual preferences inability to change. I can safely say I will be happy with this product, and it will definitely get me through to the next 3-4 years when I upgrade.", b'We could not get this laptop to do anything other than check email out of the box. It attempted to do Windows 10 updates and 10 other updates for various drivers. We have decent wifi and it would attempt to download for hours and no progress even attempted some updates overnight and they all ended up failing. We called HP and they said they could not help us that they thought this was a software problem. None of our warranties covered that. I had purchased the 2 year extended warranty as well. This was a college graduation gift for my daughter and the guy on the phone was demanding she pay them $35 and $14.95 a month for the "HP Tech" guy to troubleshoot what was wrong with her brand new laptop. She refused.  We tried taking the laptop to a relative\'s house who is also a computer tech and has really high speed internet connections to see if we could get all the needed updates installed. They all failed there as well. Windows 10 was reinstalled as a last ditch effort. All the updates needed on the laptop seem to have been installed now. We will likely consider a different computer brand next time around. I understand that computers can be dead or non functioning out of the box. Why pay for all the extra warranties if they will not help you?', b"Great computer for the money. Whole family loves it. Don't waste your money buying a $1000 laptop for normal use. We aren't drafting auto cad designs or anythi g on it but do almost everything else for day to day use", b"It wasn't a bad computer but the keyboard did not light up and after about 2 weeks the hard drive crashed and would not reboot. I returned this computer but have had success with HP's in the past.", b"Speaker died after a month. Aftger getting tech support from Amazon which included attempting to install new drivers, I was then given instructions to revert the computer to it's default state. This caused the computer to die altogether. Now all I get is a flickering white screen. Amazon tells me over the phone to contact the seller, then they tell me via email to contact the manufacturer. Hopefullt I'll get this resolved, but very disappointing to have this happen after less than 2 months after delivery. I used the laptop for work only, no gaming. Just google chrome and Microsoft office.", b'This is the perfect laptop for the price.  Works wonderfully and love having the ten key pad as part of the keyboard, as well as the touch screen.', b'Works amazing !!!  Beest purchase I have made for my buissness in a long time.', b'Excellent computer for the average user... very light weight. My only complaint would be the touch pad I suggest getting a nice mouse... the touch screen is nice, works really well.. I\'m not a fan of finger prints everywhere so I don\'t use it that much, it does work well though. I bought one that was listed as "Like New" and it most certainly was worth it. Saved my a little bit of cash on the purchase and worked out just fine. Also I noticed that others complained of stubborn finger prints on the outside. I did not have this problem at all, no worse than any other laptop I\'ve owned... I just wipe the top as I normally would and they came right off ...']}

So here it is:I have always bought cheaper laptops, $200-$300 HP's.  And I end up getting a new one every two years or so. I decided to step it up a little this time, and from the hours of research I did, this is where I ended up.  So coming from those cheaper laptops, this thing is a dream, I mean it is the Ferrari of laptops.  It's fast, and I mean instant kind of fast .  The SSD (solid state drive) is what I understand makes it so fast.  It's pretty, and clean, and feels and looks expensive.  The biggest complaint I read about this laptop before I bought it was the screen... If there is a problem with this screen, I can't imagine what the people complaining are used to looking at... It's perfect, I mean I have a nice quality 1080hd TV hanging on my wall, and the picture on this laptop screen is every bit as good.  You can view it from every angle also.  I play a little Minecraft, I never knew how awesome it could look until I got this laptop, I downloaded a shader pack for it and ran it on the highest settings... Perfection.Also, the keyboard IS BACKLIT, there seemed to be some confusion in the Q&A section on that but I assure you, it is backlit (see pictures).  I never had that before, and I never realized how valuable it is.  I will never have another laptop without backlit keyboard when I'm on it at night on the couch, it's amazing to have.If you're not a computer person, and you're having a hard time making a decision like I was... Look no further, this thing is amazing.**UPDATE: It's been about 5 months now and I would still highly recommend this laptop.  It works as smooth and fast as the day I bought it, and now I have loaded with apps and programs.  I am the person that has 20 windows at a time open and it never bogs down.  Tech gains have slowed significantly in the last 10 years or so, making this laptop as relevant as it was 5 months ago when I bought it.", b'Hello.Just recently acquired the new E5-576G-5762 (8th gen i5 with Nvidia 150mx) and have to say that this laptop is extremely decent. Thanks to its SSD, it boots Windows 10 pretty fast, bloatware is kept to a minimum (please uninstall Norton before doing anything else. :p), and the machine is definitely zippy. Haven\'t added more RAM nor extra HDD but planning to do so (and update the "review" when I do). Battery life is touted at 12 hours and I pretty much doubt it will reach that milestone (unless you are using the screen at 30% or less maybe) but it does give you at least 6 to 7 hours using it for browsing, writing, etc. Oh, and the Nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least (Grid Autosport FPS avg is in the 80s/90s or so)Initial assessment:+ Great and fast CPU and overall fast PC performance+ Backlight KB and travel feels pretty nice on the keys.+ Decent quantity of available ports+ It has a DVD drive :o+ Upgrade possibilities+ Decent Full HD screen (might be the \'crappiest\' thing on it and it is still good for the price)- Trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite- IT RUNS HOT!!!!!That is the major con for me. Running GRID benchmark, it got to a high 92/93 degrees C!!! Same thing when running 3DMark :oI think Intel CPUs limit is 100 C and it will probably start throttling to maintain a decent temperature. I guess we could probably undervolt (will look into that) or see if one of those rest \'things\' with fans could help. (Do note that this is at room temp 60-something Fahrenheit. I live in the Caribbean were temps are usually 80+ so when I go back I need to retry the test and watch the temps.Other than that, haven\'t found any major problems, but it\'s been only 3 days... Need to play with it a bit more. As of now, for $600 or less, this is a nice buy.Thanks', b'"She may not look like much, but she\'s got it where it counts, kid. I\'ve made a lot of special modifications myself. "--Han SoloI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have put my feelings about my new Acer Aspire E 15 E5-576G-5762 better.  The 8th generation processor and SSD make for a very snappy computer, and the easy upgradablility is helpful now and will be useful in the future.  Since the i5-8250U version comes with DDR3L RAM, I swapped out the 16GB from my old laptop for a free upgrade.  It took all of 3 minutes.  The hardest part was finding the 3 tiny screws that flew everywhere when I took the plastic compartment off.  I foresee a time when I\xe2\x80\x99ll need more storage, but when that time comes I\xe2\x80\x99ll get another SSD and install it.  Again, a 3 minute task.Chassis: Plastic, with a painted aluminum surface for the keyboard and track pad.  It seems put together well.  The monitor is surrounded by a somewhat large bezel, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told is a turn off for some people.  I never would have noticed had it not been pointed out in my research.Processor: This is the primary selling point for me.  The i5-8250U is substantially faster than even the 7th generation mobile processors in a very energy efficient package.  I haven\xe2\x80\x99t put the processor through anything very rigorous yet, but reading the reviews and head-to-head comparisons on the internet was convincing enough for me to buy it.GPU: A discrete GPU with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM in a computer that costs less than some graphics cards.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t play GPU intensive games, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that many games are playable with this card, just not to consider this a gaming computer.SSD: A Solid State Drive is a must have!  What they lack in size, they make up for in raw speed, durability, and energy efficiency.  I would have liked a 512GB drive, but the 256GB one that comes with the computer will last a while, and when I need more space, it\xe2\x80\x99s an easy process to put another SSD, or HDD, in the empty bay.I/O: Tons of ports, a DVD burner, solid keyboard with good feel to the key strokes, and a very precise and responsive trackpad.  The trackpad, keys, and wrist-rests collect the oil from your fingers and hands very well, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to wiping them down after every use.RAM: 8GB of DDR3L-1600 RAM.  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s enough, though I would have preferred the faster, more energy efficient DDR4.  Still, I had other 8GB sticks of the RAM available, so was able to get a nice upgrade for free.Screen:  This 15.6 inch screen is my first 1080 screen on a laptop, and I love it!  The higher definition is very apparent from the 1200 X 800 screen I\xe2\x80\x99m used to.  Plus the screen is matte, so bright lights aren\xe2\x80\x99t glaring.  Not the brightest screen I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, but certainly acceptable for all indoor use.Battery:  Coming from a 17.3 inch laptop with a 3rd generation, power-hungry i5 in it, I was used to getting 2ish hours of battery life, even with battery saver on.  Now, without sacrificing processor performance or screen brightness, I can get 5-6 hours of battery life out of my computer.  I will be interested to see how long I can get the battery to last with power saver on.  Acer claims you can get 12 hours, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.Overall Impression:  This is a killer laptop for a killer deal!  Acer has done a great job of creating this workhorse of a computer and selling it at the $600 price point.  Kudos to them.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re on the fence I challenge you to find another computer with all these feature at a similar price.  Buy this computer and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very happy with it.']}

I still have and use my portable MP3 player, I have two work phones, a tablet, my personal phone...and this doesn\'t even take into account my wife\'s phone or the kids tablet. Needless to say, we are not always around a vehicle or home power to keep things charged up. I have a couple smaller 5 and 8,000mAh power banks but I needed something with more capacity, so I thought I would give this unit a try.Many smart phones today have a battery capacity of 3,000mAh. My tablet holds almost 13,000mAh of battery charge! This Omars unit holds a whopping 24K mAh of capacity and as a big added bonus, it has a small power inverter so you can even plug in a small 110 volt (household power) item. This won\'t charge a big laptop because it can only handle 88-120 watts of peak 110v power, but it\'s a nice plus. I\'ve already used it to charge my dog\'s E-collar as well as my portable flashlight. It\'s a really nice bonus.The two USB outputs can rapidly charge your device by putting out 2.2 amps of power. I confirmed this with a meter and my smart phone also says "charging rapidly", so I know it\'s working well. The size of this power bank is about the same size as a tablet and a bit thicker, so it\'s not going to fit in your pocket. It\'s not too heavy and packs nicely in my suitcase or in my backpack. I\'m looking forward to taking it on a camping trip where it will hold plenty of power to keep our phones charged up. I have a sneaking feeling I\'ll be charging everyone else\'s phone too!I hope you found my review helpful and if so, please click the yes button below. Thanks!', b"This power bank is the fastest charging power bank that I have used so far meaning it charges itself faster. I'm homeless at the moment which means I need to charge as fast as possible. I use this to recharge my other power bank my phone and my laptop at the same time. If and when I have to replace it I will get another one. I love it. Highly recommend.", b'I purchased this to run my cpap medical device. It worked great ran all night and only went down one level. I also used it to charge my laptop and mycamera batteries. I highly recommend this device.', b"Very impressed by this small power bank. I bought it specifically to power a Philips BTM2180 micro CD system, as there was no wall outlet anywhere near where I wanted to place the system. On a full charge it allows me to play CDs for hours - I've gone through 3 CDs and there's still juice left, so who knows how long it will go for. Obviously, the charge duration depends on how much power your device is drawing. The size of this battery is also convenient because it can stand upright and take up very little horizontal space. Looking forward to taking this little guy with me on camping trips to power a portable stereo, lights, and charge my phone. I had a Goal Zero battery like this before that didn't perform anywhere near as good so I think I've found a winner here. Well done Omars.", b"This is the first time that I have a Power Bank with a Power Outlet and it is great.The OMARS Power Bank features two full sized USB Ports and an AC Input with Converter. It can be used to recharge any device that uses a USB Cable and can power up small appliances or charge more heavy stuff (such as a Magsafe Macbook) for up to 80W.It features 24000 mAh of pure power. The power bank came in a really nice packaging and was as described. Something to note is that is huge. It is way bigger than what I expected (judged by the capacity and relative size of others that do not have a AC Outlet). However, it does not weigh much related to its size.It comes with only a cable: a DC cable in order to charge it back.Some things that I'd like to have in this charger would be a USB C connector and the possibility to recharge the power bank via Micro USB or USB C. It would be better since it uses a propietary DC cable to charge it back.Overall a great power bank for the price, especially for power users.", b'This item is great used with an Extension cord it powered and 19 inch tv ,nvidia shield and a lamp for four hours,which was more than I expected for 80 buck,still look for one that can power ,a 40 inch and a Xbox one though', b'I love it it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a huge capacity then I expectedBetter then my other two sane style of these power banks', b"After several months of use, overall I'm satisfied. Works exactly as I need it for. I got what I wanted, when I wanted, at a good quality, for a fair price. Doesn't weigh too much. Takes a reasonable amount of time to charge. My only complaint is that is runs out of juice quickly when I charge my laptop while using it, even if all I'm doing is writing a paper and no other software is being used."]}

Those who are looking at upgrading a fairly old or not so powerful laptop and are looking to do a little more productivity, this is a great option.2. What do you get?Well you can probably read the description, however it\'s worth noting. You get an Intel i7 7500u CPU (dual core with 4 threads) 12gb DDR4 RAM, Nvidia 940mx GPU, a 256gb SSD, 15.6" 1080p screen, fingerprint reader, and a backlit keyboard.The reason I mention all of the feautures is because you would be hardpressed to find another laptop with these features for the same price. To my knowledge there is not laptop on the market for $800 with an i7, dedicated graphics, 12gb of RAM and an SSD. This is really one of the best values on the market right now.With all of that said, this isn\'t for everyone. If you want to do extensive gaming, this is not for you. Can it game? Yes, light gaming can be achieved, however it isn\'t marketed as a gaming laptop. Is this for someone who wants to do editing (video, audio, photos)? Yes, again light editing can be achieved.What blew me away with this computer is the speakers! They are fantastic! I usually use headphones and would consider myself somewhat picky with sound, and for laptop speakers these are really something great.This computer is really a middle of the pack all arounders dream. If you dabble in a little of this and a little of that but don\'t do anything professionally or extremely serious, this is really all you need.Also, everyone\'s experience is different. Some hate loud fans, and if this is pushed the fans will be audible. Some don\'t like that the backlit keyboard times out after 30 seconds of no use. These things really don\'t bother me.Lastly, the versatility of this laptop is really great. I\'ve bought tablets and sold them because I couldn\'t justify having a laptop and tablet, then bought tablets again because I missed the things I could do with them that I was missing on a laptop. This solved all of those issues except size. It\'s pretty big, which for some is a plus others its not.Overall, if you are looking at upgrading and don\'t want to spend $1,200-2,000 on a flagship model laptop this is a great option! I can\'t recommend this enough.', b"Better than Lenovo Flex 4. I originally purchased Lenovo Flex 4-15Inch 80VE000MUS. However, after a couple of weeks, the screen wobble, the 1/2 size right shift, and odd placement, sent me in search again. The Acer solves the keyboard issue, and the screen wobble is barely there, as I type this the Acer screen barely moves, the Lenovo screen is all over the place. The hinge on the Acer is stiffer, and wider and look more durable; and the balance between base and screen is better. The Lenovo wants to fall backwards. The Acer is fractionally lighter, on the scale. The trackpad is larger and works faster, smoother and QUIETER than the Flex 4. Acer is slightly thinner, but about 1/2 inch less wide, the rest of their footprints are basically identicalSame processor I7-7500U, 12GB Acer vs 8Gb on Flex Both are Full HD Screen, both 256SSD. Flex has Samsung passmark 4295 and Acer has HFS256 Passmark 3203. Frankly I can't tell the difference. Flex AMD Video Vs Acre Nvidia, again I can't tell the diff and I don't game.The screen on the Acer is MUCH brighter. I posted a photo of each at 50%. The Flex can hardly be seen outside, the Acer, much better, neither are good in direct sunlight. Speed, Acer seems slightly faster. Keyboard is firm and easy to type on layout on Acer is closer to a real KB. Both touchscreens work well, but the Flex 4 bounces much more. Wifi for both seem to hold the same 866 on 5ghz almost all over the house. Both boot really fast. Acer is missing Ethernet port, not something I use very often. Both have backlit KB, Sound on both is fairly decent, but I think the Acer may be slightly better. Neither has gotten hot in my lap, either during discharge or charging. Both are very quiet. Battery life seems good on both, but Acer is usually longer; Flex is 6-6.5, and Acer is 7-7.75 perhaps a bit better.  Neither has much bloatware, just the typical Lenovo, and Acer utilities and Office 365 trial; the rest is Windows 10 bloat.  Not giving Acer 5 stars because I have not owned more than a few days, If it stays fluid and reliable I would bump to 5 star, Flex 4 gets a 3 at best.All in All Acer wins for me. I like the gray steel color of the Acer better as well, and it feels solid to hold but not unwieldy.As with all things, you may have a different experience but I am very happy with the Acer R 15."]}

I looked at all of the MSi, Asus, Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sabre, etc. and to be honest, all these companies had great gaming laptops to offer for around the $1000 price point I was looking for. And I would hope that anyone looking for a gaming laptop in this price range would understand that companies are going to make compromises to reach that price range. All of the gaming laptops from all of these companies are great for this price range, and they all make their compromises in different areas of their laptops to reach that point. Ultimately though, most all of the other ones I looked at for this price were making their compromise in the the form of the GPU, stepping them down to the GTX 1050ti instead of the 1060 to try and cut costs. This was the only one that I found that still included the GTX 1060, and a 6gb one at that! No, it doesn\'t have the Aeroblade fans like some of the more expensive Predator line, and doesn\'t have a Thunderbolt port, but it does still have a USB-C 3.1, and the dual fans that it does have are still very good. I\'ll try to spare the more specific details on the specs on the laptop, as you can simply read those yourself on the main page here for the Helios 300, so I will move on to the concerns I had and what I think of the laptop so far now that I\'ve had it for a few weeks and had plenty of time to run it through the mill.There was another reviewer on here that had purchased the Helios 300 as well, and in his review stated that once he got it, Acer did not have the current driver software update on their site for the GPU, so his GTX 1060 in it was useless at that time. He updated his review a few weeks later stating that Acer did finally update their driver software support to the most current version, but I was still concerned about this at the time of my purchase. Needless to say, my concerns about this were immediately alleviated once I got the laptop, as I opened the GeForce Experience program the laptop comes installed with and was easily able to update the driver software within the first 10 minutes of turning it on. Now to my second concern I had, which was heat and coolingI do plan to use this laptop for gaming, and although I don\'t plan on doing extremely heavy gaming on it, as I have a PS4, Xbox 360, 2 ps vitas, and a Nintendo Switch, all with plenty of games on them to which are my primary gaming platforms, there are just some games you cannot get on consoles, especially indie games that are offered on Steam, and this is my main use for this laptop, but I did want to see what this thing is capable of, so I purchased The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 to really test what it can do. I\'ll say, between those two games, and above all my other indie games and older, easier to run games that aren\'t near as taxing on the hardware, The Witcher 3 is the ultimate test to see what a system can do, as it runs it HARD, pushing the CPU and GPU to their limits as is, but it does run the game EXTREMELY well, keep in mind you HAVE to be plugged in to the power supply for these particular heavy running games to perform adequately, as if you try and unplug and run them solely on the battery power, both Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 will instantly cut down to 9fps and are completely unplayable in that manner, and this is NOT something that can be changed, it is just the way the BIOS is set up. Trust me, I tried messing with all of the regular settings to which none of them changed this at all, the only way I found that you could possibly get those type of games to run at full 60+fps on the battery alone would be to go into the BIOS and turn up the voltage, but I DO NOT recommend even trying that, as it is just not worth potentially melting your computer just to do this, so settle on knowing you will need to be plugged in when playing PS4-era games. All of my other games, however that are xbox 360-era games, such as dark souls and payday 2, and ALL of my indie games, run a smooth 30-60+ fps in battery only mode. So, back to the heating and cooling, even though it doesn\'t have the Aeroblade 3D fans, the dual fans it does have work very well and are much quieter than I expected them to be, only really being noticeably audible when turned up to max speed. The rest of the time, they are barely a whisper. I want to note, that I HIGHLY recommend always running the PredatorSense application that comes built in to the laptop, as it is very simple and works great, giving you a very nice window that gives you a live feed of your individual CPU and GPU fan speeds, as well as current temperature/loading monitoring for both the CPU and GPU as well, and records all of that data on a second-by-second basis from the time you open the app to current. It also has very easy settings to use, have Auto, Max, and Custom fan speed controls, as well as having something called CoolBoost which I will get into in a moment.So, while running either The Witcher 3 or Far Cry 4, I noticed that after extended periods of play (1+ hours), on the auto setting and with CoolBoost off, CPU temp was staying around 90 Celsius, and 80 Celsius for the GPU, and there were short spikes that would last a few seconds at a time where the CPU would actually jump up to 97 Celsius, which was enough to concern me, so I tried messing with the settings more, and concluded that if you are going to play any heavy games that tax the hardware this much, I HIGHLY recommend that you turn CoolBoost ON, as once this was on, on the Auto fan setting, playing The Witcher 3 or Far Cry 4 for extended periods, it considerably helped to cut down these max temperatures, where now the CPU max was at 87 Celsius, and the GPU at 78 Celsius max. Much better. Now, as for all of my indie games and Xbox 360 era games, this ran considerably cooler, with Dark Souls pushing the CPU to 72 Celsius max, and GPU 61 Celsius max. So, in conclusion, cooling is definitely more than adequate for light to medium gaming, but to remain adequate cooling on heavy games, I recommend you always turn on CoolBoost first, but once you\'ve done so, it is adequate.In conclusion, I am extremely happy with the performance of this laptop! It hits all of the right marks for someone like me who does do medium and some occasionally heavy gaming on it. As far as all other uses, for web browsing, video streaming and similar tasks, it is more than enough to easily perform well, with web browsing specifically being very fast. It may even be enough to say it is overpowered for such tasks, which is fine by me. The ISP screen is beautiful to say the least, with very good viewing angles, having a VERY slight loss in brightness at about 50+ degrees onward, but it is so slight it is still viewable. The keyboard is very solid, and the keys have good travel and resistance, not too much, not too little. The only qualm I might have regarding the keyboard is the fact that you only get one color on the back lighting for it, red, as I understand that may bother some people, but again for the price point, some compromises are to be expected, and the red backlighting really does not bother me, and actually has really good lighting, not being too overpowering but giving you enough light to be able to easily see all keys well. The touchpad is very good, having smart gesture capability, and the left and right clicking work well on it, as well as tapping the touchpad to click. Battery life overall is actually much better than I anticipated for all the hardware it has, being able to get upwards of 8 hours with light to medium use for surfing the web and doing other things, with gaming obviously draining it much quicker, but I\'ve been able to get up to 2 hours on some games on just the battery alone without even trying to turn any of the settings down and actually having the screen brightness all the way up. The 256gb ssd that it comes with is blazing fast and I absolutely love it, but I do recommend you consider getting an additional hard drive for it as I did, as it does come with an extra 2.5" slot on the bottom to put an additional drive in it, which I ended up throwing my old 500gb PS4 hard drive in, which was an extremely easy thing to do since they made a simple door on the back that comes off after just removing one screw and is super easy to do yourself, just don\'t forget to make sure the hard drive you put in it is already formatted or empty, as I forgot to erase all my old PS4 data off the one I put in it, and ended up having to go into the Disk Management settings and delete all the partitions (save files essentially) one at a time before the computer would even recognize the hard drive, but once I deleted all of the partitions, it easily recognized it.In summary, I would definitely recommend this laptop for anyone that is looking for something similar to what I was looking for that wants to get the absolute most performance they can for a price point of $1099 and that isn\'t concerned too much about being bothered by having a laptop that looks like a gaming laptop.', b'I am amazed at what you get for this price point.Pros:-Price/Performance-GTX 1060 easily pushes 1080p monitor-Cooling seems to do a good job-Quality build-m.2 is PCIe/NVMe compatible-free 2.5" bay with mounting included-Matte screen-Not too bulkyCons (I gonna really reach here, no reason to complain at this price):-Single USB 3 port-USB C is NOT thunderbolt 3-finger prints show easily on metal exteriorThe build quality is instantly obvious. It is well made both in material quality as well as design. The first thing I did after unboxing was create a backup using a USB 3 stick which took ~1 hour. After that I opened it up and replaced the 256GB m.2 SATA SSD with a\xc2\xa0Samsung 960 EVO Series - 500GB NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD (MZ-V6E500BW)\xc2\xa0drive. The process was a little difficult as I wasnt sure how to get the base off after unscrewing all 15-16 screws. As it turns out, with the base facing up and the back facing away from you that you pull from the back vents up. The base has all around the perimeter plastic snaps that require a little effort to unsnap by pulling. Be careful these are easy to break. I broke 1 in my efforts which hasnt had any adverse effects but I could see 3+ being a problem. Once the bottom was off the m.2 is near the ram. 1 screw to release the m.2 drive and getting it back together was not issue. I also put a Samsung 850 Evo 500GB/SATA in the 2.5" bay.I installed Windows 10 Pro (comes with Home) as I have all my computers domain joined to Server 2016 Essentials (Home cant join domains). Install went smooth, setup drivers, programs, AV, etc. Computer boots in the blink of an eye, shutdown/restart is blazing fast. Updated BIOS to latest (I think 1.03 as of this review) and no issues with that.I have only played Overwatch so far, but it runs at a solid 60fps @ 1080p with Ultra settings. I know not the most intense game but still impressive. The screen also impressed me. After doing a ton of research in general and alot on this specific laptop the general complaint seemed to be the monitor. I can tell you unless you are a professional photographer/graphics designer who needs precise color that the monitor is impressive for what it is. It is the MOST matte display I have ever seen, virtually 0 reflectivity. Its 1080p, sharp, 60hz. You dont get premium features like G-Sync but if you run solid 60fps in a game theres no real advantage and its not worth $200-300 more just for that feature in my opinion.Coming from a desktop i7 4770k @ 4.4GHz with a GTX 1070 I am very impressed with this laptop. I needed the mobility as I will be working out of state and travelling alot. I notice no difference in speed, if anything this laptop is a bit faster (most likely thanks to the 960 Evo SSD). It also puts out way less heat then my desktop did. In a relatively small 3rd bedroom/office my desktop could easily heat the room up to the point of needing to open a window or point a fan into the room to direct cool air in. This laptop is not nearly as hot.The cooling in this laptop is great. In a really quite setting you can hear the fans, more so under load, but in typical settings for me with a fan on or a tv on in another room I cant hear them (especially with headphones on). The Predator Sense app is simple and makes controlling the fans easy. Without CoolBlast turned on max rpm of the fans is mid 4k, with it on the max goes up over 6k but adds a noticeable decrease in temps. I usually toggle it on when I know ill be gaming for a few hours. Temps are reasonable in my opinion (Celsius):CPU: 40min/~75gamingGPU: 60min/70max (GTX 1060 disables when not gaming, so temp is min/max gaming)In conclusion, for ~$1k you get a 7700HQ, GTX 1060, 16GB DDR4, nice matte 1080p screen, quality build, NVMe capability, free 2.5" bay, backlit keyboard. Cant go wrong at this price especially when  nothing else competes with similar specs. I am very happy with my purchase, would highly recommend.EDIT (1/2/2018): Still works great, no issues so far. Handful of updates for drivers/BIOS. I have still not seen anything that competes with this on specs/price ratio. You would be hard pressed to build a comparable desktop version of this.Very happy with it']}

Personally think the functionality could be improved so that it would be more like a laptop.However, if all you are wanting to do is stream Youtube videos, access social media sites, and/or general web browsing, it will be the best device you could ever buy. When using the hotspot boxes or jetpacks for data, be sure to turn off the setting that leaves the wifi on while the device is hibernating by going into the advance settings in the device settings. Otherwise, you will easily go through 10gb of data within 2 days. I know that from personal experience. Goes through data quickly. Not sure why that is. However, it is from personal experience that I can use up 10gb of data within 2 weeks on my Chromebook, yet it takes me 30 days to use up 5gb on my phone and tablet. Things to keep in mind.', b'Given to my daughter.  She already had one and loved it but her dog accidentally stepped on the screen and she needed a new one.  So I indulged her by giving her one.', b"I like it. I had one before this so I'm familiar with it. I was happy to see my bookmarks and passwords were already there because they were saved in google. The only thing I don't like is the missing delete button. The need to use the delete and backspace buttons slow down my typing. I hope I get used to it soon because it's driving me nuts.", b'These Acer Chromebooks are wonderful. Fast, reliable, solidly built, easy to use, perfect size. I really like them.', b'Purchased 3 in total for my children. Arrived in excellent condition, packaging was on point, setup was easy! Great purchase for a first time kiddo to have their own computer and for access to all their educational tools!', b"My wife purchased this, as she was tired of sharing my ASUS chromebook.  I didn't even know this was re-furbished, as psychically the condition was excellent.  It runs as expected, connecting to our wifi network smoothly and running at expected speeds.  The battery life is holding excellently, about 12-13 hours between charges.", b'The refurbished chromebook arrived looking brand new. Also, the sturdy reusable packing sleeve it was in was genius and much appreciated as this was given to my daughter who is not so careful with things, hence the refurbished purchase.

I paid a high price for Windows 10 -- not for the features of this laptop. Once you connect to the internet it freezes up due to the constant updates.

It is now gathering dust in the bottom drawer of my dresser. Lesson learned.', b"Office 365 subscription is for 6 months, not a year. Ok, so moving on, Got it yesterday set up was super easy.  Looks great, working great.  Although I don't need a lot of space, I am worried about storage issues when Windows starts updating because I've read that's a thing.  So far, I've used 15.6 of 29 GB just doing basic setup - no added apps.  Everything that I used regularly is already on here.  I guess I could have got a Chromebook if I wasn't really into internal storage but this unit is Lenonvo (I've had 3 and I liked them all) and the price is right.  I'll update about storage if it becomes and issue....UPDATE: After the dreaded Windows update, I have used 18.7 GB with 10.3 GB used.  Adobe Flashplayer updated as well.  I'm okay with that because I don't have a lot of software or apps that I need to download to this unit  - especially since it has Office 365.

I understand that this is a 200 dollar laptop however, the fact that it lags when using the web browser and even the office programs that are included is a joke. There is also no space on the laptop you will be constantly harassed with requests to update this and update that but guess what you do not have the space to.', b"My past lenovo was great so i went with this laptop but its a mess!! When you leftclick your mouse, the menu for right clicking pops up CONSTANTLY.  It's sooooo SLOW to respond!!  You have to add extra storage for updates and apps.", b"The laptop came with so much garbage installed right out of the box, there's not enough room on the hard drive for an updates.

Took a chance to order it online with Amazon, but wife said that she uses Lenovo computers at work, and they are fine.Pros:Came in 2 days with PrimeBoxed in a box.  Then had soft styrofoam corner protectors.Works well and is quiet.  It's a laptop with Windows 10, Can barely hear the hard drive.  Fan is a fan, not loudTouch screen, which I likeCons:2 minutes of watching the flash Lenovo on the screen15 minutes of downloading updates ( I have DSL, which sucks)During setup, the keys pressed did not always type, which s weird.  I was typing, but nothing was showing up, so had to touch the screen to retype it. Maybe it's user error, but it was when typing in my logins for emails and passwords.  Didn't happen just once, but probably 5 or 6 times.Annoying:  well, it's windows 10, and Cortana comes alive and starts talking you through the setup.  She didn't get my wifi right, and had to enter that manually.  No big deal.  Also, I told it United States on setup, but it didn't ask time zone, and for some reason it was in Belgium.

If something else goes wrong, or comes up as a cool thing, I will update this review.", b'I needed a quick replacement for my recently-dead laptop and decided on the Lenovo Ideadpad 320. This is a good budget laptop for someone who needs a cheap laptop, be it for school or work. It is pretty fast with an 8th generation i5 and 12GB of memory, but I quickly replaced the hard drive with a much fast SSD\xe2\x80\x93up to 40x faster which is a recommended upgrade for whomever is tired of slow loading of windows and applications. Also, the ports are acceptable, with 2x USB type A and 1 type C, HDMI, card reader, and headphone jack, as well as a DVD drive.Now onto the less positive aspects. The battery life is mediocre, achieving a maximum of 5 hours with regular cases of 2:30 to 3 hours. That is one star deduction for me. The second deduction is from the screen. In 2018, all laptops should have a 1080p display; however, this laptop contains a 720p display, making everything appear huge. The tiny resolution packed into a large display is unacceptable, but it is what it is. The final star comes away from the keyboard, which is abhorrent. Cheap plastic and poor layout design combine to make a miserable typing experience.Ultimately, the Ideapad 320 is good for whomever wants the best laptop for his or her money, as long as they are willing to make many compromises. Just remember you get only what you pay for\xe2\x80\x94nothing more and nothing less.', b"Nice laptop with minimal bloatware out of the box. High speed, good power for multitasking - doesn't skip a beat with multiple applications running. Lenovo has been a solid choice for my last three laptops, and this one seems to be up to the same quality standards as its predecessors after a month of use. This is worlds above HP and Toshiba, which I fought with forever before finding Lenovo. All in all, great laptop at a decent price.", b'The computer has worked splendidly. Like other reviewers, I was a little surprised how long it took to get the operating system downloaded, but it has worked flawlessly since purchase. I even bought a second Lenovo for my husband.', b"I think this is a great laptop for what you pay.  It isn't fair to try to compare this to a Mac because it clearly isn't one.  It is super fast, lightweight and portable, and features a great touchscreen.  I don't notice the battery life being poor, but to be honest unless you are lugging it all around, you usually have access to an outlet.  I am using mine mainly to write papers for my master's program and the keyboard is very responsive.  Is the resolution good?  Well, Netflix looks great to me...I'm not a techie, it works great for what I need it for.", b'Just what I wanted.  No troubles at all.', b"I'm a bit frustrated because this laptop runs soooooo slow.  I suspect since it came loaded with Windows 10, and there's all this crap loaded that you don't want is why it's as slow as a turtle.  I don't know how to go in and get rid of the useless stuff.  I will probably have to take it to the Microsoft store and have them look at it.

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

Delete all dell applications, and anything else you might not use it for. Took about 30 minutes and now this things is firing on all cylinders! Great for what I needed it for', b"Seems like a great unit have always liked Dell. The power plug is smaller than my older units, but I expect great durability. Bought this to replace my work laptop which died after 5 years of abuse! This is my third Dell I expect it last just as long. Has touch screen which doesn't seem to sensitive, the whole thing is very lite and has mosterous storage capacity. 2 freaking Terabytes! I've already had it grinding away for a few hours transfer a couple hundred gigs of data! The other reviews say its slow I have not noticed that, but DELL did install alot of crap that I don't use mostly antivirus and support programs.  Great laptop at a great price !", b"Straight out of the box looks nice great features. Runs slower than expected.  Before I connected to the internet for the first time it was running slow. After I hooked it up and did all the suggested updates still muchslower than my old laptop that only had 1gb of RAM. The wireless card doesn't support 5g and is constabtly having connection issues with various routers. It would've been great to know that it had outdated hardware before purchasing.", b'It is built very flimsy.The evident build quality is obviously poor.Like other reviewers noted, it comes loaded with all kinds of bloatware, and with an old version of Windows 10.It took about a day of downloading Windows 10 updates before I was even allowed to see the system and hard drive, in order to verify it was the computer I ordered. Then there was another day of cleaning out the Dellware. BTW, forget it if you do not connect to the internet by cable. The WiFi Windows 10 update did not work at all.I suppose if the cost of the computer is cheaper due to the bloatware, you could make arguments that it is OK. But if you want to just buy a computer and use it right away, don\'t get this thing.For instance, it comes with McAfee antivirus. It only took two days before I was getting pop ups for an expensive monthly subscription to McAfee, or "be unprotected".  It took me quite a while to figure out how to remove McAfee and start up the free Windows Defender.Even after a lot of effort on my part, the computer is still infected with Dell software, and I expect I will never quite delete all of it. Little windows keep popping up asking me how I feel about Dell service, for instance. It is very difficult to know which program from Dell is needed for something essential like mouse support, and which one is basically Dell spyware.The hardware side of things is no picnic.The thing re-boots itself once or twice a day for no apparent reason, and then starts up YouTube and plays the last YouTube video I have watched. So in the middle of the night YouTube starts playing, and I have to unlock the screen in order to turn it off.After it self re-boots the touch screen feature often will not function. A re-boot will not bring back the touch screen, but so far a complete shut down and re-start will fix it.The touch screen, when it does function, feels crude.The speed of the computer is adequate for the price. And the screen viewing angle is also adequate.But the case and keyboard feel like a cheap disposable toy.Obviously, I cannot recommend this, but I am lost as to what else I might choose. From what I can see, the other manufacturers are all just as cheesy.Good luck!Update -  after 3 or so weeks.  The computer has been stable and works as it should.  The initial setup was a grind. But it has not re-booted itself for the last 3 weeks, and the touchscreen is functioning.', b'I do not work for Dell but computers are my business.  This is a very good laptop for the price.  At this price do not expect a gaming machine but expect a stable computer to surf the web, email and play some videos.  Other reviewers tend to think that you should be able to play the newest games on ultra high settings for about $400.00  There is a reason there are still $2000.00+ laptops out there.', b"Within three weeks of receiving the laptop, it started to go through the dell testing upon booting it up.  This is over a seven hour process.  When it was almost done it would freeze within the process.  I would have to restart it and start all over again.  If I had it longer I would send it in for repairs, but I've only had it three weeks so I'm just going to return it.  Will be purchasing an Asus or Lenovo in the future.", b'Unfortunately received an older model Dell Inspiron (NOT 2018), non-touchscreen (ordered touchscreen), and only 256G SSD (ordered 2T). Hopefully this was and oversight and not intentionality sent to bait and switch a novice computer purchaser. Disappointed.', b"SLOW!  I just upgraded my internet connection to gigabit service and this Dell only downloads about 40 Mbs while the Windows 10 Lenovo I have 3which is supposedly not as strong because it is two years old downloads through my Wifi at over 500 Mbs, Wired at about 700Mbs. The screen touch lags and the computer itself is over-all slow.  It's a shame because Amazon Trusted logo was present when I purchased it but no longer appears on the page."]}

I thought this would be it, I was wrong...The harddrive comes to you more than 50% full, so it\'s more like having a 16 GB HDD.This thing is incredibly slow. It crawls out of the box, even after disabling all of Dell\'s preinstalled bloatware. I would expect a 1.6 GHz dual core to perform better, especially one with a built in AMD GPU. Just how slow is the laptop? Well, I didn\'t use it to write this review; that should tell you something.

Not an armored tank like my old Dell Latitude was, you\'ll want to protect this one, it seems a bit delicate but not too cheap looking or feeling. Luckily it fit my laptop bag just right. After the Dell finally crashed, I bought this one and for my needs, its perfect. It surfs the net pretty quick and definitely happy about that. I haven\'t had to wait for anything to load and plays YouTube vids just fine. I like the solid touch pad molded into the case. Touchpad will lag when you first turn on the computer and during set up, but after it comes to life. The screen is glossy, but not as sharp as I hoped, but it\'s still better than my old Dell was. I bought the HP X3000 laser mouse to go with it. Overall, I\'m happy with it so far. Considering the price (Paid $260 here on Amazon) and the features, I\'d say I made a good decision with this computer. Its only been on for about an hour and a half, I\'ll post an update. I hope my review helps you in you search for a new laptop.FYI This is Windows Home. You have to purchase access to Office. I write So I downloaded a free Office program that works with Windows 10. I downloaded Open Office for free. It comes with a drawing program and a presentation program, so there are alternatives to make your capabilities complete.Update: 10 Hours since turning it on. Unlike my past experiences with new computers, this one hasn\'t given me problems. And there are no useless programs to get rid or bloat ware. Big pluses. I like the computer.Update: 3/10/17: Ive been using it for a few days. Things I like: The indicator lights like that blinking CPU activity light is side mounted along with power indicator light, its also side mounted so the power button is not lighted. The only thing on the keyboard that is lighted is the Caps Lock key. It appears as a glowing dot. That\'s nice. No blinking lights to distract me. I also like the roomy, uncluttered look of the keyboard area, whatever its called, and I like the full chicklet keyboard. The computer is growing on me. It has had to "Working on updates, do not shut off your computer" followed by 30 or so minutes of blue screen. Its done this twice since the initial start up. Otherwise, its running well. Its a good size you can watch a movie right on your lap like a personal theater. Ive been using it on my lap, it doesn\'t get too hot. The sound is pretty nice. Some media you have to turn the volume all the way up, some not. The sound is good, nice clarity and sounds as if its surround sound, but don\'t expect much umph in it.Update 4/21/17. Been running smoothly. No problems or annoyances. I\'m happy with the computer.Update 8/19/17. Its been a good computer exept for its need to update often. I can say there has been 10 or so times that it updated. And it never fails to have yet another update available 10 minutes after it updates and reboots. Its really really annoying. Good computer, but annoying updates. When is updating my 2017 computer going to end??', b'For $250 you\'d be hard pressed to find a better deal. This new HP is loaded with "junkware" and that\'s why the price is so low. Right out of the box do a Windows 10 System Refresh by hitting Update & Security > Recovery. Click or tap the \xe2\x80\x9cGet Started\xe2\x80\x9d button under \xe2\x80\x9cReset this PC.\xe2\x80\x9d This will remove all the CPU sucking junkware and you\'ll be left with a bare-bones operating system that runs perfectly. Just add your software and it\'s like a $800 machine. Case is awesome, very lightweight, sleek and track pad is solid. Speakers are above average when sitting on a hard surface and with headphones it sounds great. Screen resolution is perfect for HD movies. Battery life is about 4.5 hours with continual use. It\'s well designed and for half the price of a mobile phone it\'s a solid 5 stars.', b'Just purchased this computer and at first the CPU was constantly at 100% and in the red.  Now for the price this computer has a relatively good CPU.  This CPU has a benchmark of around 2600 which for the lay person a benchmark is a way to rate CPU\'s/Processors.  Most computers in this price range have a CPU benchmark under 1000 and the higher the benchmark the better.  This computer comes with bloatware pre-installed which slows down the computer and fills up the processor to 100%.  After some work this computer is now running great with the CPU holding mostly at around 39% and startup time is at 42 seconds now compared to more than a minute and a half right out of the box.Here\'s what i did.  First I downloaded "PC Decrapifier."  This tells you which programs on the computer are not necessary and which ones are and recommends which ones to be deleted.... for example one of the unnecessary programs was "Tangent" games.  After that i downloaded "advanced system tools free" and scanned and cleaned the computer and then in that program went to "startup" programs and chose to run only the necessary programs to run upon startup.  I added two 8gb ram sticks to bring the total ram to 16gb which was very tricky but there is a YouTube video on it and now the computer is running great.  So that being said the computer is functioning very well for the price paid with a relatively decent processor.  The end!', b"I've used this laptop for several months now and I just love it. It loads quickly and has everything I need for my home use. The display is crisp and bright. It's been a very good buy.", b'So many features for the price. I had been holding out because i didnt want to lose Windows 7, Windows 10 is not that much different and this HP is loaded with just about, or more, technology than the Dell I paid $2000 for 7 years ago!', b"Excellent laptop for the price.  Everything functions quite well.  The specs are in two places.  One never mentions Bluetooth, the other, says NO.  No Bluetooth in this model laptop so you can't connect to external speakers.  The Product specs should have NO Bluetooth in Bold print. Other than that, excellent!", b"Overall I'm happy with my purchase. It's not the fastes laptop I've ever owned but it does the job, the resolution is okay and the sound quality is great. I bought it as a secondary PC for work mostly and it will serve its purpose perfectly fine. I love the design, it's thinner than I was expecting, it comes with optical drive, the keyboard is excellent as it's actual full size, you know with the number pad included .Is perfect for the price!!. I do have to complain about the power button position, I've found myself turning the laptop off instead pressing the escape key.", b"The design of the computer is very nice & the outside of the laptop is coarse to the touch. The performance of the computer match's the design of it being a piece of future tech. It showed me what's new in Windows 10 which is a good operating system and they changed the login screen finally. I would recommend this computer. I will give an update in 30 days of any changes good or bad."]}

Please continue reading:I was eyeing this laptop for several weeks now. I was hoping to get a good Black Friday or holiday deal on this item but that time never came so I bit the bullet and got it for $199 (which is reasonable).At first glance, this is quite a small laptop. I\xe2\x80\x99ve used 11.6\xe2\x80\x9d laptops before but with the thinness and weight, I was somewhat surprised by the size and worried that the keyboard would be hard to type on. It did take about two hours of consistent typing for me to get used to this thing. I type a lot of research papers and this is one of the more responsive keyboard laptops I\xe2\x80\x99ve used. Of course, not macbook quality but definitely better than the other budget laptops on the market. Compared to my 13.3\xe2\x80\x9d ASUS chromebook, the keys on this model are more cramped together and smaller in size. However, it is surprisingly nicer to type on and isn\xe2\x80\x99t mushy like the former.As far as battery life goes, I started at 100% estimated usage time of 12hrs. I did a full update, streamed 30mins of video, played 2hrs of pandora, downloaded a bunch of apps and installed google chrome. After all of that, and approximately 3hours later, I still have 62% battery left. I imagine that it will live up to the advertised battery life with normal use. At most, the laptop has gotten slightly warm, not enough to bother anyone should you choose to to use it on your lap though.Memory and performance. OK, this is largely the reason why I was wary of purchasing this laptop. It comes with minimal storage. After all the updates, I was left with 16gb of SSD. I did purchase a 64gb micro sd card for this laptop and all it took was changing storage preferences to get everything directed to the SD card. I did experience some trouble at first as the storage settings did not save for some reason and I had to redirect everything to the micro SD twice. It appears to be working properly now though and apps download relatively fast on this thing. I currently have 16 tabs open on Google Chrome (yes, I am that person) and everything is still running smoothly. The only lag that I\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced was using the Edge on this machine. Do NOT use edge! Just download google chrome and save yourself the trouble.Display and Build quality: Again, this is a very thin and lightweight laptop made out of entirely plastic,  so it feels somewhat cheap. But I think the design and aesthetics may make up for that. At a glance, it looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s made out of aluminum. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into what color it is, as it varies depending on the lighting. But it appears to be a more expensive product than it really is. The screen itself is actually pretty nice for the price. It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stream HD videos well but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not an eyesore either. Another thing I should point out is that the black bezel on the screen is indeed plastic. (For some reason I thought it was going to be glass.) As far as ports go, all of them are in working order. I did have trouble with the USB 2.0 port as it was rather snug which made inputting and removing USBs rather difficult and with excessive force, unfortunately. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if this will be a long term issue or if it will fail on me in the long run but I\xe2\x80\x99m optimistic.Overall, this is a nice inexpensive laptop that will exceed expectations for anyone simply needing a laptop for essay-typing, web-browsing, and light weight tasks. It is extremely portable and is a great option for people looking to travel with a laptop. For the price and performance, it's worth it.", b'OK, so I was eyeballing this laptop for 2 weeks. Each time I wanted to order it the stock/shipping option on Amazon was not very appealing. However, I guess I got lucky, and I ordered it on Saturday 10/15/2016 (when was in stock) and received this laptop today 10/18/2016.Pros (for me) :- lightweight- good battery life- good speakers- good travel size- good for watching movies and web browsing- Windows 10 64 bit , 4 GB RAM, microSD port, fast A/C WiFi- casting videos to smart TVCons: (based on my opinion)- Hard drive is small -  usable space is around 14 GB, 64GB would be perfect;  but, this one is not a biggest issue for me - 128GB micro-SD card or USB are cheap.- USB ports only 2 - additional USB 3.0 port would be awesome.Bottom line :For $199 it is a pretty good laptop for basic computing i.e watching videos, playing music, web browsing, and basic office/college tasks.Not sure about gaming.', b"Great little computer for writing papers, browsing the web, and watching videos. Very convenient for college students and travelers because the size and weight. I'm satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a computer for using Microsoft products, YouTube, social media and light gaming.", b'This review is specifically for the 14" L402-WA-EH21.First off, a little bit of background: I am a computer person. I build, rebuild, and maintain computers both in professional and personal life.The Good Things-This computer is light weight, easy to use, feels good to type on, and starts fairly quick. Everything about this PC is built specifically to be lightweight and slim. It is specifically built to do web browsing, emailing, instant messaging, and lightweight document creation. Think of it like a Chromebook but running windows. Youtube videos run smooth, network (while n compatible, ac-based) is wifi is zippy but wired is faster, and the screen is bright and vivid (with the right settings). If you are student that needs a budget document creation tool, this will do it. If you need a computer to quickly look up information, close and toss around the living room, or send emails to grandma; this machine will do it.It also has a 2.5" harddrive bay in a cover under the bottom of the laptop (not advertised but it\'s there). I have installed (and highly recommend) a 250gb ssd for the additional storage space (and if you are going to be doing any type of heavy document creation, you will need the space). It works fine without reducing battery life.At the moment, the longest I have used it was 3 hours before plugging it in, but that was because I was leaving for several hours. probably would have made 4 before having to plug it in.The Not-So-Good Things-The L402WA-EH21 has no documentation online, has no specs listed through the ASUS website, and apparently doesn\'t exist other than it is listed on Amazon for sale. The closest model is the E402WA on the ASUS site and comes in two different versions (i think the E is Intel based, the L is AMD based). Given that you are considering purchasing this laptop, all the documentation that you will have will come in the box; a basic start up manual, a warranty card, a small bag of screws (for the harddrive expansion bay), and a power supply.The Bad Things-I received this laptop and plugged it in and fired it up. Standard Windows set up and logged into the desktop. Always first thing to do is to check that Windows activated itself properly. It did not. Alright, so I thought there might be a problem with the OS that was installed on it, so I restored the system using the builtin restoration partition (takes about 45 minutes). I redid the Windows set up, and waited. Same information was stored in the restoration partition as was in the original install. Windows wouldn\'t activate.Alright, being a computer guy, I dug out the tools and scanned the keys that were installed from Asus. The version of Windows installed was 10Home, the key installed through BiOS/UEIF was a 10RTMCore, and had an origin key of 10RTMCloud. All three of these keys are for different versions, none of which are interchangeable with each-other.If you research the OS that is suppose to be installed on this computer (Windows 10S) you will find that it is identical and interchangeable with W 10Pro. Being a  computer guy, I wiped the boot drive and installed Windows 10Pro from a flash drive (takes about 45 mins), did the Windows set up, had the OS pull the key from BiOS ... Windows not active...!At this point I was at a loss as what to do. I did a few activation tricks and called Microsoft Activation to see if i could manually activate Windows 10Pro. Talking to a Third Tier Tech (first two were impatient and useless, about 45 minutes being bounced around), the Tech checked the three keys that I had. The W 10H key was already registered and in use (so dead), and the W 10RTMCore and 10RTMCloud had not called home properly. YES! Two keys were available, one of them was no longer viable. Here\'s the nail in the coffin, I asked the Tech where I could get a ISO (the installer disk) for Windows 10 S (10RTMCloud). His exact answer "Unfortunately, there is no way for you to get ahold of a 10S ISO image. They are distributed directly to manufacturers only." ... Great... Just great...So... After all of that I had a brand new key, a new laptop, and no way to put the OS on it that it was suppose to be installed! Mind you, this is five hours into taking it out of the box. I finally was just about to throw it back in and ship it back when I decided to dig around in Google.So... after about an hour, I found a fix. It\'s complicated, it\'s doable if you are moderately computer savvy, and have about two hours of time; no software needed to be stolen or borrowed from illegitimate sources or anything.1. Get a Windows 10Pro image set and ready on a flashdrive and bootable.2. Install 10 Pro onto the laptop WITHOUT changing any partition information (simply delete the OS partition and stall Windows 10Pro in its place) and bypass the key entry section during install.3. Once the computer is set up and running at the desktop, check to see if the key has Activated. IF IT HAS YOU ARE FINISHED. If not, continue.4. If Windows 10Pro did not activate, you need to find the installer for W 10S. You cannot obtain an ISO, you must use an \'Upgrade\' like installer. The webpage to search for is "Test Windows 10 S on existing Windows 10 education devices". Read most of the page so you know what you\'re getting into, and download the installer.5. Run the installer. It will do an \'Upgrade\' install, move all of the associated profile information to a Windows.old folder on the C drive, and install Windows 10S.6. Alright, you\'ve done this step before. Go through the Windows 10 set up.7. Once you get to the desktop, check to see if Windows 10S has been activated. At this point, Windows 10 pulled the key from the BiOS/UEIF and registered properly!8a. At this point you are ready to run. Go ahead and use the laptop as you want. You will need to run DiskCleanup as administrator to wipe out the Windows 10Pro files that are completely useless and just taking up the tiny storage.8b.If you plan on installing any software that is not Windows 10S verified (through the Windows Store) to be lightweight, this laptop HAS the ability to be upgraded to pro through the Store. Search for \'Upgrade to Pro\'. It will upgrade you straight away without installing anything else. Everything that Windows 10Pro needs is already in 10S, anything that isn\'t will need to be downloaded and installed (which if you need them, you will know where to find them in Programs & Features through the Control Panel).Final Thoughts-Generally, I like this lightweight system. It does exactly what I need it to do; run several messengers, word processing, quick internet searches, basic presentations, and occasionally watching Twitch. If you need a small computer, this will do the trick! If you need something to run Photoshop, you will need something more powerful. If this system had of been manufactured with the proper OS on it at the getgo, it would have gotten a 4/5 Star rating... Seriously.... SIX hours of my life are gone because someone in OSImaging didn\'t get the memo that the BiOS/UEIF had a Windows 10S and not Windows 10Home, or 10RTMCore... If you manage to get this system with Windows 10S and not have to go through a ton of set up, or have the technical ability to do EVERYTHING I did it will be a good lightweight system. At the moment, I cannot confirm that any of the units available have the proper OS on them. I have posted the above information for anyone that might run into the same problem and really REALLY want to give the system a good shot before throwing it back in the box and sending it back.']}

I had only 6 GB available out of 29 (I'm going to see if there's anything I can clean up or bypass so I can get some additional memory here).Runs slowly (likely due to memory).Does NOT come with MS Office installed. It formerly had it installed but it doesn't have it installed now.PROS:My laptop came in GREAT shape (no dings or anything).I'm a student and MS Office can be utilized online for free though my school, so I don't *HAVE* to download it (but I'm clearing up memory and I'm going to).Overall: I think it'll get the job done. I'm a college student and a busy mom of three. While it's slower than my desktop, I think after a little adjusting, it'll get the job done. It'd be nice if it had more memory and I didn't have to adjust it myself, but you get what you pay for.", b'The computer is really nice, just needs a sd card to help it function better. Before or after purchasing buy a sd card to ensure you are able to add music and pics. The wifi picks up incredibly and Cortana is always there to provide help. I highly recommend purchasing this product', b"The Stream is a pretty decent laptop for college students running on a tight budget. It's good for casual web surfing, playing media such as videos and music, schoolwork, and can even play some light gaming (League of Legends on extremely low settings). The only drawbacks I found since buying this in August was the storage space and mousepad. The internal memory goes up to 32GB and since it runs on Windows 10 there are updates that will take up the storage pretty quick. Also, the mousepad can be unresponsive and sluggish when moving the mouse around the screen. To solve these issues, you can either buy a microSD card (it can go up to 64GB) and insert it in the small slot on the right side, or delete some factory apps that are pre-installed on the Stream to save space, and buy a mouse (either USB wired/wireless) to make the best out of the Stream. Overall, I found the Stream to be an awesome buy for its price. It's not the best laptop nor a bad laptop but it definitely gets the job done.", b'I purchased this laptop for my daughter because of the size and how it was advertised.  She needed a smaller laptop to carry around on campus.  It\'s lightweight and serves the purpose for her needs.  It was clean, easy to get started and easy to navigate.  Having Windows 10 and Office 2016 already installed was a big plus.  My only issue with this laptop is that space seems to be limited on the hard drive.  A lot of the space appears to be used by the OS.  With every Windows 10 update, more space is consumed.  The "running out of space" error messages constantly appear.  I would think that a 32 gig hard drive is more than enough space.  Other than that, it\'s fast, has good connectivity, good screen resolution and is easy to carry.', b"I deal a lot with Laptops, was expecting so much more from this little guy but the processor is absolutely garbage. No matter how many times you run a disc clean up, cc cleaner, etc that won't stop the processor from giving a 100 percent usage all the time. Don't even bother uninstalling apps to speed it up, I removed all the useless apps, but the Processor is always having a hard time, and lags constantly. The worst part is that every 20 minutes the screen has a quick 0.5 second crash!  The touch-pad is also terrible, a wireless mouse is needed at all times.", b"Great product at a fantastic price! Doesn't have enough storage for full Office functionality, but it's great as an internet computer.", b'This works great. Exactly what I needed. Small, lightweight, and powerful enough to run Google apps smoothly on Chrome.', b'The main problem is the 32 G, I was not even able to update Windows 10 because I had no space on C drive.']}

(included)\n            '}, 'reviews': [b'I purchased this computer because it is advertised as a "Signature Edition" computer. And that it definitely is - not a single piece of bloatware on this thing - a clean installation of Windows 10 and that\'s it.  What a great experience in getting to the desktop for the first time and not seeing it half filled with a bunch of "crippleware" trial version programs that you have no interest, nagging you to update to the full version; and no shortcuts to web pages full of advertising and cookie setting bots. When it finally gets to the desktop after the initial setup, you\'ll be ready to immediately go to work and not spend the next hour deleting programs you don\'t want. Especially nice is that it doesn\'t come with a trial version of an anti-virus program that you\'ll either have to pay for the full version in 30 days or go through a complicated uninstall process. Yes, I know that I\'ll get some flak for being a fan of Windows Defender, but for everyday, normal home users Windows Defender (which is installed on this computer - it\'s part of Windows 10) will work just fine.This is a basic computer that will work just fine for any home user. If you do video editing or are a heavy PhotoShop user, then this one probably isn\'t going to work for you. It has a lot of memory (8G) and a huge hard drive (1Tb) which are great pluses for this price.A couple of minor complaints: 1- no "power" indicator light on the power switch - the first time you turn it on out of the box, you\'ll be hitting the switch a couple of times looking for the light. 2- like some other Reviewers have noted, this thing is pretty "plasticy" - I wouldn\'t buy this if it is going to get bounced around a lot. For normal use, though, it\'ll work just fine. Others have complained about the heavy track pad and buttons, but I use a wireless USB mouse as I don\'t like track pads, so I have no opinion about this issue.  Also, this computer comes with a touch screen - I am used to having a mouse, so I probably won\'t make heavy use of the touch screen.  I did verify that it works.As with any new computer, don\'t turn this on for the first time until you have an hour or so to wait for and monitor the Windows Update which will run when you first use it. It did download and install 4 Gb of updates fairly quickly (about an hour in my case). The initial setup went flawlessly.Finally, a note about Prime shipping on this. This is advertised as Prime eligible, but it will not be shipped by Second Day delivery. A number of reviewers have posted negative comments on the Vendor\'s review page about this issue. This is NOT the vendor\'s fault. This computer comes equipped with a Lithium-Ion battery and federal regulations prohibit shipments by air of lithium batteries over a certain size and capacity. So the vendor has no choice but to ship this by Ground  (UPS in my case). So please don\'t rag on the vendor about this. Instead, criticize Amazon for not making this issue clear on the product page - Amazon should put a clear message on the product page that this item is not able to be shipped by Air and it will take a few extra days to arrive.If you\'re looking for a nice, easy to use computer for home (or a basic office setup), you need look no further than this one. And definitely well worth the extra couple of days it took to arrive.', b"Good machine for the price. Fairly sturdy case, no bloatware and quick setup. Music sounds surprisingly good and full. Much better than expected and much better and slightly louder than my other HP Elitebook. Keyboard is good and keys feel solid, not too mushy. No backlit keyboard but at this price, I wouldn't expect it.Complaints: Plastic. I know everything's made of plastic but this thing is ALL plastic, even the track pad, which is incorporated into the case (see pic). It's not very sensitive and just doesn't feel great. Also, the mouse keys are harder to press than they should be. It takes a bit of extra firmness to click them. I'm sure I'll get used to it in time but I wish HP had made this better than they did. One positive about the integrated trackpad is the ease of cleaning. It's smooth and rounded 3/4 lip won't trap stuff like a fully-seated pad does. I hope that makes sense. I think it does. :/That's about it. Otherwise, it's a good value and I'd purchase it again.", b"The keypad's keys are hard and uncomfortable to use but a wireless mouse is a fairly cheap buy and thus far it's a decent laptop", b'Nice little rocket!  Windows 10 takes some getting used to, especially with Chrome Browser.  When I switched to Opera it took back off like the rocket that it is.', b"After a few months the screen has bubbled and there is an inky substance running through it. I contacted HP and they said the warranty will not cover this and it will be a $500 repair.That's more than the laptop cost brand new!Now I have a useless 4 month old laptop.Very dissatisfied with HP and their service.", b"Boots fast, on the desktop logged in within 45 seconds. Not even a solid state drive, that's surprisingly good.The keyboard is perfect, I had to return a different brand laptop because the mushy keyboard was unresponsive but this laptop was the perfect replacement.I have plenty of RAM to multitask many Chrome Tabs, Photoshop, and even a game at the same time.It runs simple games like Town of Salem and Dota  (minimal graphics) just fine but City Skylines struggles. It's perfect for streaming games through Steam on a local network though.It draws about 20W or less while in use with a charged battery compared to almost 500W from my Custom Gaming PC. Good way to save power when not needing the beefy PC.The touchscreen comes in handy all the time but keep in mind you CANNOT use it to paint in Photoshop- it is restricted.Fingerprints overall do show,  all over.  I always wash my hands on the job but I still manage to leave marks all over.Very happy with my purchase and price so far.", b'For under $400 including delivery I am impressed with this purchase. Before writing a report I wanted to give "this thing" a good going over. I have put it to work extensively for the past two weeks and I can\'t find any area of deficiency. It boots up very quickly so that I can get on with productivity.Initially I had difficulty with the touch pad which I thought was insensitive, but I have since discovered the reason. Because this unit is black all over, my finger was straying outside the touch area therefore missing the most sensitive area. A distinguishing colour in the touch sensitive area may have made a difference but I do not know how achievable that would be. The touch screen is a different matter altogether. It\'s very responsive indeed just like the more expensive ones in the market. I like the fact that the battery charging indicator tells you how much charge you have left and when charging tells you the time remaining to achieve full charge. The cd/dvd  drive works well. I have not tested the speaker sound quality because if I need good sound I would rather use a Bluetooth speaker. The unit feels solid, as solidly put together as others in the market, and it was delivered with good packaging and on time.  I endorse.']}

I\xe2\x80\x99m not a big fan of writing reviews but this product is really good. I bought this laptop for my sister, she is a college student. Great computer with touchscreen. Fast, very responsive screen. Great memory capacity and RAM, which is very important for her. And a great price for all this features! I\xe2\x80\x99m very satisfied with my purchase.', b'I gave this laptop five stars, because it is all that I had expected it to be and I like it very much.  HP has made all of the necessary upgrades; so now it works absolutely perfect.', b"Great laptop..runs fast and I love the full size keyboard.I will say the windows updating took no time at all for my computer.I noticed some reviewers were complaining it took forever to update.It could be your internet connection possibly,because I don't think it's the computer.", b'Good purchase for the money. Bought it as a gift, so I hope it performs as well as I expect it to.', b'I recently purchased this laptop for school. It runs fast and I would highly recommend this computer for school work', b'With the disclaimer that I primarily use my laptop for internet access, this is a great computer for the price.  Much faster speed and a much more "solid" feel versus my old laptop of a different brand.  Love the touchscreen. Though there are not a lot of bells and whistles on this model, if you use it for internet access and are not a gamer, I think you will love it.  Great value for the money.', b'The built quality of the laptop is very poor, it has already started to break near the charging port. Never expected that the HP will make such a flimsy build quality. Highly unsatisfied with the product. I will not recommend this.']}

My partner wanted the Dell Inspiron 1550, and I thought I'd try this HP being half a pound lighter and except for the fingerprint scanner on the Dell, had the same processing power.  Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like the more lightweight laptop, it was simply junk compared with the Dell which was only about $20 more expensive.  The display on the HP was grainy, the Dell HD.  The HP has a mic, the Dell has stereo mics.  Dell has a great fingerprint scanning option, the HP did not.  The keyboard on the Dell had easy to read and well-spaced keys, with or without the backlight.  The HP's keys were difficult to distinguish from one another, with the light from underneath being brighter than the keys, and very narrow spacing between them.Last, the breaking point that had me stop setting up the HP, was that with each required update, the Dell was consistently twice as fast and each update was easily accomplished.  Several updates on The HP, for some reason, kept completely failing, requiring extra hours for the update.", b'GREAT COMPUTER.  SPEEDY AND EASY SET UP. LOVE THE BACKLIT KEY BOARD AND THE TOUCH SCREEN OPTION!!', b"Came preloaded with bloatware. Some security app said there were 447 critical issues that needed to be addressed and asked for a credit card to do it. Had an outdared version of Dropbox with no clear way to update.After using the built in facility to reset to PC to bare Windows 10, it's working well with software I actually want.", b"Seems like a solid laptop. Basically what I was looking for a a good price: Quad core processor, touch screen, backlit keyboard, good amount of RAM and storage for streaming media and begin entry level programming. Also Bluetooth and Windows 10 is a plus. Minor games just for fun seem to be running alright as well. All of the other laptops I compared to at this price did not have ALL of these features so I felt this was the best value.The only cons of this laptop seem to be the battery life seems a little low, roughly just over 3 hours while I am multitasking different windows and apps, but maybe I need to play more with the battery saver, and it does seem to charge pretty quickly. Also I don't like the speakers being on the front/bottom of the laptop, when the laptop is actually being used on my lap, the speakers are a little muzzled.The speakers could be a little louder, as I like to blast my music loud, and when placed on my lap or a pillow or the couch or anything not a hard surface the sound could be restricted.", b'My reason for a three is that the first day it worked ok and the next I could not e ven sign in,  Had to recover the whole system which took over three hours and shows they ha ve poor quality control,  Yes works fine now and is a good computer,', b"I had a cheap Lenovo and knew I had to replace it as the pointer was uncontrollable and frequently changed pages. I go through computers usually once a year, but there is always a family member to inherit my old ones. So I struggled along for a year with the Lenovo and finally got this Hp onAmazon's sale day. But I'm sure it hasn't changed the price much if at all. What this HP has is stability, a backlit keyboard, and a touchscreen, all of which the Lenovo didn't have.  I don't store huge amounts on the computer. Most of what I want is in the cloud or on a jump drive(for backup). So I have all I need in this HP. I have actually bought lots of HPs & been happy with all of them. Since I run a small business it's easier to just format them yearly and give them to someone in the family who needs it . Then I just have to upload a few programs and work in the cloud.", b'Laptop arrived on time. Packaging is smart and protective. HP got this one right. After letting the battery charge. Booted up the Windows 10 install. Hp streamlined it to a extent. Cleaned up the unneeded programs. Less bloatware than experience in the past. I5 processor is very good quality. Appearance and design is very practical and advanced. Surprisingly lightweight. Yet a sense of being a durable product. HP and Trivalley this is a very good laptop. Thank you.', b"All is great with this laptop except the hard drive. The hard drive is so slow, that the 8 GB's of ram, and 4-core intel i5 processor have no opportunity to be utilizied. I uninstalled all of the bloatware, and installed advanced systemcare pro to optimize the system. I can't do much of anything without reaching 100% disk usage, freezing windows explorer. I will be replacing the hard drive with an SSD drive, but between the drive and purchasing a copy of windows 10, that is going to add another $300 on top of the price of the laptop just to get it to run without freezing."]}

The 12 GB memory and SSD disk speeds rate especially high, around the 75th percentile.  So booting and loading apps is blazing fast.  I just wish I knew more about CPUs before I purchased.  This uses a 7th generation I7 processor (I-7 7500U), which rates around the 50th percentile in terms of all CPUs.  Quite fast for everyday use, although it rates in the bottom third of the many flavors of Core I-7 processors.  But I have some spreadsheets that use computation-intensive simulations that can really benefit from a speedy CPU.  I didn't know that an 8th gen Core I-5 processor like the 8250U is actually much faster for heavy computing (I figured any I-7 CPU has to be faster than any I-5 CPU...silly me).  And you can get an I-5 8250U processor for only $599 in the Acer Aspire E15 model on this site.  It has only 8GB RAM, but it would've been a better fit for me...120% faster spreadsheet processing versus my old laptop instead of the 50% gain this Lenovo gives me.

My old travel laptop finally died and I hate spending lots of money for a travel machine when all I need are the basics.  I refuse to travel with a laptop that requires "the cloud" to function properly.  I may pull the 4GB RAM and put in an 8GB card, but that\'s for later.Oh, and I noticed several people complained about the track pad.  After downloading all the updates, I noticed one of them was for "track pad update."  My pad seems to work as well as my other PC after the update.', b'This laptop is not for gamers or those that need powerful editing programs. It is a couple steps above a Chromebook,but a couple steps below the more expensive and powerful units. It is a great in between for those that need the basics but want more than a Chromebook.It provides a large amount of storage space-I ended up with around 420 after with Windows and other pre-installed programs already built in. There is also a slot for a SD card if you need/want more space.While DVD/CD drives are becoming a thing of the past, it is nice to have one built in this unit and I consider this a huge plus.If you travel a lot like me, you might want to go with a smaller screen as a 15 inch screen can be difficult to pack and carry along as you go.The only complaint I have(so far) is the quality of the track pad. It is not the best, so I recommend getting another mouse.', b"Had it almost a week now and I love it. Plenty of hard drive space, a disc drive and best part is that it's not a crappy chromebook. It's got everything I need and the price is right. I recommend this to anyone, especially if they live paycheck to paycheck.", b"This is a bottom of the line, VERY basic laptop. Expect that, and you won't be disappointed. The one thing that really irritates me is the fact that it was loaded with McAfee Anti-Virus software that was a demo. After a month, when it expired, I began receiving daily messages to purchase McAfee to protect my computer. Still getting 'em to this day. Ugh.The quality of the build is lackluster, but is on par with what you pay. Plastic, cheap, but efficient enough, if you are a casual home or office user. Not good for traveling.One of the best features of the laptop is the DVD drive. It's cheap and flimsy, so you need to be delicate with it, but it's a GREAT option.", b'hardware is OK but the software preload is disastrous. Disabling all HP services and removing everything called McAfee helps... Having 2 AVs running in parallel (the MS one and McAfee on top) kills about 1/3 of the performance without even doing anything...', b"I bought this laptop at the beginning of 2018. It's a cheap, yet decent for the price, refurbished laptop. However, after I unboxed it, I found they hadn't set it for OOBE (Out Of Box Experience), which is how most computers are initially set, so you can customize some of the settings and create your user account. And, certain things didn't work, like the Start/Windows button. It was somewhat unusable in that state, so I did a complete reinstall of Windows.  (Thankfully, I'm a computer tech by trade, and have already done this stuff plenty of times before.) Also, upgraded the memory from 4 to 8 GB. Not terrible to get apart and not too many screws to worry about. You pretty much just pry the plastic shell from the bottom to get to the electronics. Also, as a side note, the refurbisher slipped in a single half-sheet of paper explaining what was included with the laptop. Fine, but the part where they wrote that Microsoft Works, not Office, was the current productivity software was a bit of a head scratcher. Works had been discontinued in 2009. Not trying to be harsh, but I'm not sure what happened there. Despite that, the laptop looked and operated fine. But, if I weren't a tech, I can imagine the frustration I'd be going through.", b"I wish I would have read other reviews before I bought this. Others are saying they had problems within a week or two. Mine was defective right out of the box! I just got through set up when it froze and wouldn't do anything. It said sign in was bad. I was trying to replace my old laptop so I don't have to deal with stuff like this. Shipping back asap! What a waste of my time", b'Within a week of arriving it had a small problem after an update installed.  Contacted HP customer service who said (to my shock) that it was "No longer under the 90 day software warranty."  They wouldn\'t help me even though they knew I had just purchased it as "new".  Told me a LOT about what I could expect from them in the future, so I sent it back, and will NEVER buy HP products again.']}

It's funny what a difference a year can make in low end PC performance. 4GB of RAM is good for multitasking.While I like the performance I was disappointed that the laptop has so little storage. 32GB isn't much and it will prevent the installation of more applications. SD cards inserted into the laptop's card reader do not sit flush to the unit making carrying additional storage less convenient.The 14 inch display, while large and at a nice 1080p resolution is a very low quality TN display. If the screen is not positioned properly the image will look washed out or lose its clarity.Video playback is dramatically improved over prior generation hardware and it should have no issues playing back HEVC video : even the high bit rate stuff. I was impressed to see that on a low cost laptop.Overall this isn't a bad deal for the price tag. I would have liked to see more storage but if you're looking for a Windows laptop to run a few applications and spend the rest of your time in the cloud this should be sufficient.", b"It\xe2\x80\x99s probably best to start by clarifying what this laptop isn\xe2\x80\x99t. It's not a desktop replacement even for an office environment. The 32GB hard drive just isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to operate at the core of your workflow, even if your workflow is mostly spreadsheets. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a premiere media consumption device, the screen isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough and the speakers leave much to be desired. It certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to handle any gaming outside a very limited sphere of low spec games, even then I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend it. With all that out of the way, what does the Aspire One do a good job at? It can handle office tasks, web browsing, and media consumption.The build quality of the laptop is great for the price point. The keyboard is good and the trackpad is okay. The only major letdown of the actual construction are the enormous bezels around the screen. In 2017, they\xe2\x80\x99re almost comically large. The screen is also a letdown with terrible viewing angles and colors so off it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to tell you\xe2\x80\x99ve found the right viewing angle even when you try. I understand the prestige the engineers were going for when they offered a full 1080p display on a laptop at this price point, but I would have gladly sacrificed the screen resolution for better colors. One of the only redeeming factors of the screen is its brightness, allowing for usage outside on a clear day, if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to squint just a bit. The webcam isn\xe2\x80\x99t much better, offering just enough definition so that you can safely identify who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to. The microphone is grainy and can\xe2\x80\x99t handle even a slight breeze, though it does compensate for changes in volume very well.When it comes to raw performance the laptop is surprisingly good. Due to the SSD, the boot time is excellent and the tasks it can run with its limited memory are always snappy. The WIFI card is good enough for taking advantage of 30 Mbps plus internet speeds and the Bluetooth pairs quickly. By far the biggest bottleneck with this device is the limited memory. Even when you\xe2\x80\x99re being conscious of your activity, running no more than two office applications at once, be prepared to encounter at least one warning a day from windows about your RAM limitations.PROS:Good ProcessorFast Hard DriveGreat Boot TimeExcellent Battery LifeFull Version of WindowsNo BloatwareCONS:Poor ScreenLimited RamLackluster TrackpadBad SpeakersNoisy WebcamA student might reasonably ask, can I get by on just this laptop? The short answer is yes, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a bit risky. Even if your major isn\xe2\x80\x99t film production and you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to edit 4k footage on a daily basis, I still wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend it. If you chose to make this laptop the core of your workflow you will be forced to kiss any serious multitasking goodbye, along with large amounts of local storage. You\xe2\x80\x99ll end up keeping close tabs on your files, pushing a lot of them to an external drive or cloud storage. It would be a good idea to pair the laptop with even an entry level desktop or just find a way to get a higher end device. With that said, if you only have two hundred dollars, go for it. It\xe2\x80\x99ll handle all your office tasks.Buying budget products today is filled with uncertainty. Even when an item has the specs to do what you want, there\xe2\x80\x99s always a lingering anxiety that the day may come when you need it to perform and it will let you done. This is especially true for something like a laptop, the center of the mobile workplace. Despite its price, the Acer Aspire One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint, it handles office tasks well and operates okay as a media consumption device. What more can you ask for the price?", b'So, this is a honest review on the Aspire 1.The notebook is fast, with the Celeron N3450, browsing, loading speed etc are good. The 4GB RAM plays a nice role here for a budget computer. You can use this notebook to work such as programming, office things and of course for educational purposes if you are a student. This notebook is NOT for advanced image and video editing or 3D thing. In fact, heavy software like Photoshop etc must not be installed. The notebook is too basic for these tools in terms of system requirements. You get Office 365 pre-installed as a trial period. However, I removed it for LibreOffice. Moreover, regarding the screen, it is NOT an IPS display. The display is matt but you can play a little with the saturation if you want. However, I leave it like it is, I do not have any issue. The sound is not that best performance, but it is good. The keyboard is good, responsive.The only ssue is the storage which is a 32GB eMMC and you get around 15GB left de to pre-installed Windows Home. I will gve you few tips how to get more storage as follows:-Once you buy the notebook, the first thing to do is to UPDATE the Windows Home. Download all updates and install until no updates are available.-After successfully updating the notebook, free the space by removing the previous version of the Windows. It will save you around 2.5GB.-Now, uninstall all pre-installed tools you will not use.-Then, install your software you will use.-Clean registries, junk files and cache from browser.If you still need storage, then use an external Hard drive.The battery is OK. If WIFI is ON, and if you are just browsing without watching videos, it can go up to 10 hours. If WIFI is OFF and you are doing just basic office tasks, it can go up to 11 hours. I decreased brightness to save battery. The charging is quite fast, 1 hour already more than 80% charged.Ask questions if you have,,']}

I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for internet browsing/gaming and school work so it will be more than enough for what she needs.When a laptop is sold as "Certified Refurbished" I expect to receive it in like-new condition.  I don\'t mind a ding here or scratch there as that should be expected on a 5+ year old laptop, but it should also be clean and all consumables should be replaced with new parts.I gave this laptop a 3-star rating for the following reasons:- When I removed the bottom cover the fan was caked with dust and I had to clean it.- My daughter complained the laptop battery dies within 10 minutes after she unplugs the power cable.  I inspected the battery and it is original with a manufactured date of 2012.  The battery should have been replaced with a new one before it was sold.- Windows reported it was not genuine and could not be activated.  No instructions came with the laptop and it was only when I inspected the battery that I found the refurb sticker on the bottom that contained the new Windows key.  I changed the Windows key to what was printed on the label and activation succeeded.  I am familiar with the process but others may not be and have a difficult time trying to activate windows.  A simple instruction sheet will help in those situations.I would also like to add that Amazon support was very helpful.  Amazon could not replace the battery since only aftermarket options are available and sold only by third party re-sellers, however they issued me a promotional certificate in the amount of what it will take to buy a replacement battery to use against my next Amazon purchase.', b'Didn\'t expect greatness because it\'s refurbished but...I got this strictly for job hunting,  phonics for my nieces and for my sister to type papers.1) PACKAGING/SHIPPING 5 starsIt arrived on time with no damages.2)PHYSICAL APPEARANCE 3 starsIt was obviously used (pen marks) but no dents,  cracks etc.3) PERFORMANCE 1 Star-Resolution was terrible. The initial startup the picture is sharp and the colors are rich but once you get to the homepage it starts to decline-the keys were not configured properly (I select "?" and get "\xc3\xb7")-Windows 10 wasn\'t installed as advertised, instead it had Windows 7. I was directed to update windows to have access to windows 10 but every time I tried it ended with a message telling me to update windows \xf0\x9f\x98\x92- kind of lack speed- other than the symbols the rest of the keys were accurate- it turned on without problems- it had all the other features listed including a voice activated assistantDespite the malfunction with the symbol keys & the poor resolution I was going to keep it for job hunting purposes but then I ran across the issues with Windows and took that as a sign to return it.If I were a parent of a college aged child I would consider this laptop for theire basic needs like type papers & emailing... maybe research.  I definitely would not use it for gaming, movies or any other animated entertainment.', b"For the price, I think this a very good laptop.Laptop: It came in really good shape. I'm always hesitant on buying used parts or whole systems. However I couldn't be more pleased. There is very little ware on the keys, touch-pad or any of the ports. I had read from other reviews that it was a gamble on the battery. I plugged it in while i did the installs and updates. Now that i'm typing this out and going through my settings, the battery has hardly budged.Distributor: It arrived a day before the eta.  And based on what I said above, they did a great job fixing this up for resale. All instructions on setup as well as contact info should you need the 90 day warranty were present and easy to flip through.I'm very happy I decided to buy this.", b"I purchased this laptop from a seller called Laptop Experience and I couldn't be any happier, I've been using it for about 2 weeks already and have no issues at all. Since this item is refurbished it came with a little dent on one of the sides of the screen, but barely noticeable, I put a protective sticker on it and that took care of it. The performance is just great and for the price this is the best you can get!", b'Meets and exceeds all expectations.Low battery life, but I keep it connected to power. I got an updated version with Windows 10. Blue tooth capabilities.fast and efficient. Durable.', b'Came with a non working DVD player and I had to pay to ship it back', b'Amazing bargain at $221. Certified refurbished, so everything should work as new. And it did. My daughter had been saving for some time, to purchase a laptop, and we came across this one in our searching. 8g ram and a 500g hard drive are generally unheard of at this price, without the refurbish factor. Yeah, it looks a bit less sleek, and a bit more boxy,  than some newer models, but she is happy with the look, and the box is really the least important factor. With good reviews for this device and from this store, we took the leap, and are very happy we did so, as everything works as it should.', b'Almost like new.  One minor cosmetic flaw, but it looks great and runs great.  I feel this was a good low budget option over buying new.']}

Your login for the device is your Google account login.- Chromebooks run an operating system that is not Microsoft Windows or Mac OSX, so make sure to consider the compatibility of any programs you plan to use.- ChromeOS is relatively low maintenance (no need for anti-virus or anti-malware programs, and no need to wait around for lengthy system updates).Now for some pros and cons for Acer's Chromebook 14 (Certified Refurbished)!Pros:- Solid build quality and design for this price ($200). The body of the laptop is brushed aluminum, and the keyboard keys are made of matte plastic, so the whole thing stays looking clean as fingerprints and smudges do not appear so prominently.- 1080p display, perfect for watching videos. It is also an IPS panel, so colors are generally more distinguishable and the screen image does not distort or become discolored when viewed from different angles (Note: many cheap Chromebooks have do not IPS panels).[UPDATE: Took me a while to notice that the display resolution is not set to the native 1080p out the box. You will need to go into Device Settings and up the resolution to 1080p. I suspect it is set it to run at a default lower resolution because running 1080p on a 14\xe2\x80\x9d display make the icons and UI elements much smaller, and turning down the resolution also means improved performance. But I bumped it up to 1080p anyway, and unless you have a problem with slightly smaller icons, it runs just fine... and it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful!]- My certified refurbished unit was almost like new. No scratches to be seen, and the screen, keyboard and track pad were clean. Original feature stickers were also still on the device.- Wireless capabilities are pretty good. It supports wifi protocol up to 802.11 ac, and it features Bluetooth 4.2.[UPDATE: I was able to pair my wireless Apple AirPods with the device, but it seems there is a very slight delay between when sound reaches the left and right ears, so this causes a slight \xe2\x80\x9cecho\xe2\x80\x9d when listening to audio. I noticed this mostly when listening to YouTube videos. Additionally, sometimes the audio would sound very quiet even when the system and player volume would be maxed out. Not sure if this is just an issue with AirPods and Bluetooth 4.2.]- This is one of the Chromebook models that support the installation of Android apps from the Google Play store.Cons:- Android apps are a great addition, but without a touchscreen, using many apps with keyboard and track pad can be awkward, or even impossible. Additionally, many apps are not optimized to run on a display of a 14-inch 1080p laptop, so some apps might not scale properly and end up looking stretched and squeezed across the screen.- Display is anti-glare, but sunlight and bright light in general can still wash-out the display and make it difficult to view. (but I still cannot stress enough that the display is still better than most Chromebooks)- No SD card slot. Do not plan to expand the internal storage, so Google Drive or other cloud storage services are necessary if you work with large amount of files.With all that in mind, it is often useful to own a Chromebook as a secondary laptop. In my own case, I use a desktop tower running Windows 10 for running engineering programs for school, locally storing large files, playing graphics-intensive video games, and running any software that requires a system with a bit more performance power under the hood.I use my Chromebook for web browsing, media consumption, and online document editing and sharing on the go. Additionally, Chrome OS does have a remote desktop tool available, so I use that to connect to my main PC over the internet from my Chromebook 14. This works beautifully at 1080p resolution and quite smooth when internet connections to both devices are strong and reliable (ideally have the main PC connected to wired Ethernet).", b"Just got this the other day. Previously had the Acer C720 for the last couple years, which was a workhorse. I got this in hopes of getting an updated version of that laptop, and mostly got that.The Good:-Much prettier. This laptop takes a lot of cues from Macbooks. If you're a fan of that look, with aluminum and black plastic as the main colors, this is a much cheaper route.- The specs are better. 4 GB of RAM means you can have tons of tabs, which I do. The processor isn't much faster than the C720, but it's a quad core, so you can run a couple different tasks at the same time.- Screen is gorgeous. It's not retina good, but it's a damn sight better than I'd expect on a Chromebook.- It's thin. Not quite Air thin, but thin.- At 200 bucks - wait for a sale - this is a really good laptopThe Bad:- Mostly just the battery life. I know you can't put a nicer screen, better specs and a thinner chassis and expect battery life to improve, but I'd peg the max on this laptop at 8-9 hours of use, which is a disappointing drop from the 11 to 12 I got with the C720.- The keyboard feels small for such a large space. There's a good amount of dead space on the sides of the keyboard.Overall, well worth the money. You can buy seven of these for the cheapest Macbook available. And unless you're doing heavy duty graphics work or gaming (why would you do that on a laptop, anyway) this is more than enough power for your daily tasks.", b"I bought a certified refurbished one with only $186, and it is almost perfect with this price. The two points that I am not satisfied with are that the refurbished one does not come with free 100G google drive and that this model uses eMMC, so you can not upgrade the storage by yourself.This model support Google App store. However, in the current version of Chrome OS (v58, stable channel), you have to do some tricks to enable it. I believe the Google App store will be officially supported in the next version of Chrome OS. Also, this model comes with 1080p support, but by default, the resolution is set to 1536x864. You have to change the setting by yourself.### Update after 6 months:This Chromebook is still my favorite one. I use this Chromebook for web browsing, Netflix, making slides, and programming. I do the programming on remote Linux machines. And the native terminal of Chromebook is good enough, though I have to use crouton for a better shell and a better environment. Also, the battery can last over 10 hours (sometimes over 12 hours, depends). Finally, since last month, Google Play store has been officially supported. No trick required for enabling Google Play anymore.The only drawback for me is this Chromebook doesn't have a powerful CPU and GPU. I tried to install Steam (Linux version) and play some 3D games. Steam worked well, but the games didn't. Even the beginning animations of those 3D games cannot be smoothly displayed. But this laptop only costs $186, so nothing to complain.", b"It worked fine for a few months, then it began having a very slow wifi issue. I searched for this issue with this model online and it seems this is a known issue with this model Acer Chromebook. Apparently the wifi antenna is in the screen and the connection wire runs along the hinge, and it breaks after a few months. So the wifi card still works, but it's getting a very weak signal. How weak? Sitting in the same location about 40 feet from my router my Macbook Air gets a ping in 27ms, a 70.51 Mbps download speed, and a 5.85 upload speed. switching immediately to the Acer 14 the ping speed is 51ms, download speed is 10.94, and upload speed is 5.87. The download speed is 7x slower! We have other devices in the house, none of them suffer slow wifi either. It's definitely the Acer.Unfortunately the problem didn't show up in time for me to return or get support for this refurbished Acer CB3-431. After research it does appear to be a common problem, so buyer beware."]}

This keyboard is a little more spread out so it may be more comfortable for a man\xe2\x80\x99s hands.Anyway, does what I need it to do.', b'I like this laptop. This is the third Lenovo computer that I have purchased. The laptop is light weight and the keypad feels good. One note though, I could not run Bitdefender because the laptop did not have enough Ghz. It does come with 30 days of McAfee.Another note: the touch pad does not have a scrolling feature. You can set it to scroll using two fingers on the touch pad. This takes some time to get used to. Despite the lack of these features, I still like the laptop.', b'Very poor and slow. Perhaps i got a bad one and amazon is returning but it was extremely slow and would not even allow factory reset to take place.', b'Great buy on this laptop! Great price and great quality new', b"I ordered this because in the past, Lenovo has been an excellent computer manufacturer. When I opened the box, the computer was very sleek and nicely designed. It was the size I needed and the keyboard was very ergonomic. The problems started when I initially powered up the device. It began making a rattling noise like a pin on a record player nonstop. I looked through forums and saw the same issue. I went to Lenovo support and they said is was a common issue and that they were changing the HDD in them. The computer was also terrible laggy- I couldn't browse multiple tabs, the screen kept refreshing, etc. For the price, this computer is loaded with bloatware and unacceptably slow. It is a complete waste of money- Buyer Beware, it is not even good for light home use."]}

Snapped perfectly into my 1545.  Followed the instructions about cycling from full charge before use and then recharging when discharged down to 7%.  Works like a champ.', b'only had it a few days but was fully charged ready to go and with the new cord I also bought with plug into computer that fit and stayed tight has put new life into my old computer. Very pleased and a great value.', b"It fit my old Dell laptop and has been working great. I honestly didn't expect it to work as well as it has been.", b'Since this is a battery, it will take at least one charge cycle before I can provide an actual review on product quality. This review will be updated once I have had time to truly test the product.That being said....Pros:Delivered on time and in good condition.Nice / fair price point for this product.Contained instructions / first charge cycle / usage card that (and this is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT) is legible with large print, grammatically  correct and in English. I have purchased WAY too many electronics I could not read the instructions (even with magnification) and those that I could magnify where in broken English and not easily followed.Cons:If there are any, I will modify this review.', b"So far so good. Replaced the factory battery in a Dell laptop with this one and the computer recognized it without any problems at all. I'm getting anywhere from 2.5 to 3 hours or so of life out of this batter on a full charge and that is about what I would expect. Of course that is with continuous use. It sure beats the heck out of spending 4 or 5 times as much for a direct factory replacement. Quality is top notch. It seems just as well built as the factory original. I can't tell the difference. So far so good.", b"Working good so far on old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1545. I'm also using a new Dell PA-21 65Watt Adapter for it, which is same as old stock Adapter. The new battery didn't recognize the old adapter so I was lucky enough to find same one on Amazon \xf0\x9f\x98\x80", b'Purchased for a several year old Dell Inspiron. The computer is seldom used but battery life never was very good. To be fair it may not have been "seasoned" properly, but in last year or two, life was down to about 10 minutes. The new battery has restored life to two and a half hours or more. Needless to say, quite happy with it.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

I bought this as a quick replacement for my old laptop since it took a crap on me. So far it's been fine, but the keys stick A LOT. Not a big deal for me.. What's a big deal is now my mouse doesn't work because it's not compatible with Windows 10. Even had to delete it from the computer it's self. Very annoyed with that. You should buy a wireless mouse on the off chance it happens to you as well. Windows also takes most of your space, after the little bit I put on the pc I now have less than 10 gigs of use. Which is an upgrade from my old laptop, but I dislike how it's going to updates. I've used maybe 1-4 gigs all together leaving me with the 9 or so. There is a lot of unnecessary stuff, so I'd do a detailed uninstall / clean. It looks as described, the charger is easily replaceable if you need to. My last laptop had a cellphone charger-esk plug. Where as this charger is much more easily attainable. It lasts a very long time battery wise, and you only need to charge it for about 2hrs, I suggest doing that when it's about to die as your battery life may be cut short. The photos I have are when I first un-boxed it. The box it came in was highly protected, I've kept the box in case of a move.", b'I like the laptop but as others have stated the space on here  sucks. I wish can return it because I cant even download microsoft office onto it which is the one application i really need. Very unsatisfied with my purchase. I suggest you look around for better alternatives.', b"This computer is excellent for the price! I purchased this laptop for my Daughter for under $200 dollars! I bought it for her for Christmas so she could play her Sims4 on it. With the memory that is built in it, the Windows 10, and all the updates you couldn't really download a huge game like the Sims4. So I went to Staples and bought a 64 GB flash drive for $20 dollars and now she is able to download and play all kinds of games including her Sims. This computer is made for just Web browsing, Work, or School work but if you have the extra money to get a SD card or Flash Drive and you want to use it to play games, I would suggest doing these options first before getting an external hard drive. I know my Daughter loves it. I also bought the rainbow keyboard to go with it! Now she can have it to play games which I am happy because that's what I initially bought it for! You definitely can't beat the price! One happy customer! \xf0\x9f\x98\x81", b'I wish I would of listened to the reviews on this laptop before buying it. I also wish I could return it.As others have said the storage is horrible. I have a constant low storage icon that I can do nothing about. I have nothing downloaded on the laptop just the stuff it came with. Because of this I cannot download any antivirus protection because there is no room. The battery life sucks, at a full charge I get maybe an hour of unplugged battery life. There is no internal fan to cool the system so it gets really warm. The biggest annoyance I have is after an hour or two the laptop needs to be restarted to refresh it. I was in the middle of typing when my keys stopped working, the only one that would work is the P and all that did was try to get me to print the page I was on.It is no good for streaming Amazon Prime movies/shows because they do not load all the way and buffer every 5-10 minutes.The pros are it is lightweight, the color is nice vibrant purple and that is about it.', b'Just got my laptop last Wednesday and right off the bat...Kept getting low storage messages. Turns out the storage was 25 outta 29.9 already used. Tried factory reset..nothing. Took this laptop to U.P.S. today..on return for my refund. BE CAREFUL!', b'Love it, love it, love it.  A full size keyboard, with very limited memory.  I solved the memory issue, by adding a SDHD card, and two USB thumb drives.  I use one thumbdrive for business records, and the other for personal (photos, etc.).  I have had my machine for 3 years, and it is going strong.  No problems, other than the limited memory issue.  You can\'t always add bulky software, unless you strip out a lot of other "stuff."However, most software solutions are online now, and it has not been an issue for me.  I love this machine so much, as it is priced right for the projected life span of the technology (I usually replace my computer every 3 years or so).  I have gifted this machine to three family members, who also love it.  It is NOT a desktop computer, and it does not have the memory for a lot of bulky programs.  But, nearly 100% of my tasks are completed on Microsoft office suite (Word, Excel), or online.  Highly recommend.', b"This computer is good for surfing the web and working on documents. But you can forget about saving them. There's no room to save them. You can also forget about updating the software because there isn't enough room on the harddrive to accommodate the latest windows updates. So every time you log on to it, you've got a notification that it can't update.It's incredibly annoying. It was handy for my last semester of college where I was writing papers every week, but now it's just collecting dust on a shelf in my closet. Soon to be listed on let go."]}

It is so slow. If I type my name, my fingers will be finished typing before the first letter appears on the screen.The computer is constantly \xe2\x80\x9cworking\xe2\x80\x9d - the machine is running, making all sorts of noise, when I am doing simple things like reading the news online, with no other programs open. It takes forever to scroll down on webpages, and the problem is not our internet, as we can easily browse on our tablets and phones. In fact, I am writing this review on my iPad as this Lenovo computer is just too clunky to even write an amazon review in a timely manner!', b'Do not buy! I sent this Computer back today. Pathetically slow. No way a 2.4 Ghz processor! Took forever to load updates.', b"This laptop has worked great.  It's used for only for work/school purposes, not gaming.  For the intents it was purchased for, it has been awesome.  Additionally, it lightweight and easy to move around with/handle. Solid value.", b"Save your hard earn money and buy something else.  I can't stress enough how hot garbage this POS laptop is.  IT IS SOOOOOO SLOW! All I have on it is windows office like word, power point, excel, etc. and you would think i have 10000000GB stored on here because it is THAT SLOW! I open up a window nothing happens okay I click on it again then all a sudden 15 windows open and lord have mercy buckle in because its going to take 50 minutes to try to close that. THEN it would randomly shut it self down after 5 minutes of inactivity! I have changed all the settings I could to stop it but nothing would work and btw everyone has ben googling the fix with no help! PLEASE PLEASE save your hard earn money and get something else!", b'My new Lenovo laptop is Awesome , it has all the features anyone would want on a computer , super fast shipping !! I would highly recommend this product , and anyone would recognize the Lenovo name , this is one truly awesome computer !!!', b'Bought as a replacement for a 10 year old Lenovo T500 at work. Positives: Screen, price. Boot-up time is much better after deleting bloatware. Google "How to remove windows 10 bloatware". It\'s not the lightest, fastest or most power efficient laptop, but at $250 (1/4 the price of a phone) it does a great job.', b"Worse computer I've ever buy in my life slow like snail can't run even properly with just a couple open windows i.e like document or a music file open it freezes or takes forever to respond,should have an option where you can put no star \xf0\x9f\x8c\x9f", b'Slow as can be. Although aesthetically well designed, the parts used to manufacture it are flimsy and problematic especially the keyboard mouse (right and left clicking). Never more disappointed. I should have returned it immediately. Its become a tabletop riser for my original thinkpad. Not worth the perceived savings.']}

voice-operated Web searches, calendar updates, and media controls.", b'I bought this laptop for internet browsing, email and travel. Decided to do a clean install. Used the "reset" feature in Windows to install a basic version of Windows 10 without all the crapware. This part of the installation went very smoothly.I highly recommend you get rid of the crapware. In addition to taking up drive space, most of the crapware runs in the background, bogging the computer down. It is ridiculous that Dell puts all this crapware on such a basic machine with such limited space. No wonder so many people complain about insufficient drive space.After the clean install, I had about 1 GB free. The drive space was showing red. Was sure I was going to have return the thing. However, I found a 4GB folder in Windows that apparently contained a copy of the old install (it was call EBT, EHX, ERB, or something like that (three letters). Deleted that folder, and my free drive space jumped to 10GB. I don\'t know how 4BG eventually equated to 10 GB during the deletion process, but I was quite thrilled to have 10GB free after reading some the horror stories on here about insufficient drive space. It seems that these complainers must be overloading their computers.Tried to update Windows and it just plain would not do it. Would get to a certain percentage, 45%, or 95% or 6% and then freeze. Researched the web thoroughly, trying various "fixes"; no dice. This was very difficult to troubleshoot because of the time that elapses during update -- you might wait for an hour or so (or all night) while updating, only to have it fail at 98%.Finally decided to check the BIOS and update it if needed. There actually was a new version of the BIOS, so I flashed that. Miraculously, that was the problem that was freezing the Windows update!Have now installed Firefox and my email client, along with a dozen small utilities, and I still have 9GB free. I bought a 32GB Micro-SD card to hold some extra stuff, that part works very smoothly, and is plenty fast enough.The laptop is not slow at all, in my opinion. Much snappier than what I had before (Acer 1225B). I think the solid state drive makes a huge difference.This laptop is not for games or video editing. If you avoid such uses, and you don\'t want a danged Chromebook, it\'s a good deal.', b'Strengths: Nice crisp sound with headphones, great lightweight machine and power cord, cool running (no heat whatsoever from machine or power cord).  Also, contrary to some odd reviews, I get full network speeds with wifi.Limiting qualities: Small hard drive, low-power processor.  A small amount of patience must be acquired for those who are using this to replace a full spectrum, mid/high-powered machine.  You\'re not getting a $500 tablet or a $900 laptop in disguise.  You\'re getting a light weight, light power, 11" display machine that is worth what it costs.  No more, no less.Takeaways:  As a teacher who does not much more than word-processing, streaming music, and light internet use, this machine is ideal.  For what it costs, it\'s a great value and unlike a chromebook, it can run full applications instead of online versions of office apps.  Any of the flaws that other reviews have included have proved either to be false or a result of limited knowledge or unrealistic expectations on the part of the users.  A small amount of tech-saavy for tweaking things like the hard-drive hungry OS files and the sluggish touchpad settings can make this a perfectly acceptable machine.Tips for success:1 Windows takes a lot of the hard disk space right off the bat, but as Windows overwhelms the hard drive with its updates and preloaded software, one can clean off extra programs and can prompt Windows to delete old and no longer used versions of itself.  This gains back about 50% of the space initially swallowed by Windows and its inevitable updates.2 Make sure and get a microsd card and an external cd-rom3 Use the Dell touch-pad utility to up the touch-pad sensitivity/speed to avoid frustration.', b'After you update Windows a couple times, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a message that there is no space left on the drive for another Windows Update. This will happen even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t install any other software or data on the drive. 32 gigs is just not enough to handle multiple Windows updates even if you keep deleting the unused files. Why would anyone design a computer that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have enough space to keep Windows running? Here is a partial response to my complaint to Dell:I understand your concern related to the storage issue and I apologize for the same.Also let me explain about the storage capacity on this system and how it works.This laptop is designed for basic purposes like surfing the internet, watching videos online, reading emails, etc.It has storage sufficient only for the Windows operating system and some basic applications which aid in using the system.This takes up a major portion of the available storage on the 32GB hard drive leaving very little or no space to save/store anything else on the system. Over a period of time windows updates and temporary files would occupy the remaining space on the hard driveSolution for1. Unable to install windows updates due to low disk spaceSince the system requirements from Microsoft for the latest windows update require your system to have free space of 8GB or more on the hard drive we will not be able to install the update from within the operating system. What we can do is use another computer (If available) and download the update on a flash drive using the steps mentioned below and reinstall the operating system.Note: This issue might reoccur and you may have to follow the same steps in the future wherever any new update is released for the windows 10 in future.Here are the steps to guide you to download windows 10 through media creation tool.Note: The Operating System re-installation would wipe the Hard Drive clean and you stand to lose all the data you have on the system. This includes the pictures, documents, music, etc. Any applications like MS Office, Quicken, etc. you installed after getting the system will have to be re-installed. So please backup the data on an external storage device or cloud. However, you cannot backup the applications. You would need the product key/ License key for the applications during re-installation.']}

This particular one was purchased as "refurbished", but I honestly can\'t tell the difference! The laptop came boxed in the original packaging and was protected by plastic sleeves inside the box. Getting it set up and running took less than 10 minutes and was so easy. I\'m pretty good with technology, but someone with little to no experience with computers would still have a very easy time getting the Chromebook set up. All it took was powering it on, entering my gmail information and I was good to go!I have a regular laptop at home and intend to use this one to carry to class and take notes since my other laptop is a 17" and is fairly hefty. This one is small, lightweight, and very portable. I\'m also impressed with the battery life on this Chromebook- I charged it fully and it took me 3 days of use for it to need another charge. Loving it so far!', b"Excellent chromebook.  Packaged in it's factory box and appears brand new with zero signs of wear - given it's refurbished, you would never know  Fantastic performance as you would expect from a Chromebook - fast, reliable, and safe.  Started quickly and updated itself immediately.  And a quality Samsung build as well  Overall couldn't be happier with it!", b'Not sure if this product is really refurbed! Looks new feels new smells new! Came very well packaged and was charged and ready to go out of the box. Very happy with the product. I will be ordering a few more very soon.', b"Basically I like it. Simple, easy to use. Don't need to worry about any thing.However, the RAM is only capable for very light usage.I would recommend you the 4G version,", b'Seems like a new machine. Came with a 4.5-hour charge. Full charge overnight brought it up to over ten hours total projected.Since I was using Chrome for most of my online work, it was a smooth transition. This is a great spare laptop.Okay. so this is a new document in my little bitty Chromebook. I kind of like it, really. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve set up the big mouse cursor and the other stuff. It types real fast. It\xe2\x80\x99s all google web based so there\xe2\x80\x99s no problem with having to back it up. It has a 2 gb ssd drive so that\xe2\x80\x99s fast, even though it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t store very much. And it has the two USB ports, one of which I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try out right now.Works really well! I like the way it\xe2\x80\x99s set up, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not as intuitive as my MacBook pro. But I like some of the non-Window-ish features. The backspace key, for example, deletes as it backspaces. In that position on Windoze, the delete key deletes forward. (On Mac, both are easy to do. The Function+delete key deletes forward on a Mac.)All in all, I like it so far. The keyboard has a nice touch; easy to see key tops (though I wish they were lighted). The screen is small but very clear and bright. This is perfect for what I wanted. When I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take my Macbook Pro, which is a big one (17\xe2\x80\x9d), this little fella is just fine. I can do what I want, back it up on a flash drive, and I\xe2\x80\x99m in great shape. Yeah. I like it.', b'This is a truly great product for the money and it appears as "new" not refurbished.

Easy to operate & get setup.', b"This review is all about the price point and purpose for using.I loved this product.  Got 2, set them up for my kids.  I was able to install a few programs I didn't want...the one hang-up i had was with McAfee...I made the mistake of installing a different anti-virus/firewall at the same time, and the temp McAfee kept crashing the system...so, highly recommend you uninstall all unneeded programs before you add others.I updated to Win 10, installed Microsoft Office, added skype, added firefox/chrome, everything works great.  Skype quality was same as other computers I have.  I am not running anything heavy (including games) on these computers...they're basically functioning as chromebooks with local storage.  I think that's the best comparison for these...they're simple and designed for someone who can't quite commit to a completely cloud experience.No problem w/wi-fi or connecting to my wi-fi printers.  Battery life is as advertised for now, but will try to update after a few months' use.It's slightly slower booting up than my faster computers (duh!), but overall, I am thus far very impressed with the quality for the extremely low price.", b"Great, everything works perfect so far. Can't beat the price either. Saw this same laptop at Sam's Club for almost $500!", b'I had been lookiing for a nice computer to give 9 year old, grand daughter, for school.  I was not aware of what they needed, but I was sure, this would be more then enough, for a first school computer, and the touchscreen I knew, sure is handy.  I got a matching rubber keyboard cover and 3 year guaretee, for her, and had all shipped to her house.  Everything was much better then she needed, and she really is happy, I knew the rainbow, keyboard cover would be the envy of her classmates as well.  I so liked it, I bought myself one as well.w/o keyboard cover.  I, also, have another very sick friend in nursing home, who suddenly was without her computer, as her fanily wanted for another purpose, so I bought a 3rd one of these, to be sent to her, but, unfortunately, came to me.  I, finally got it to her, unfortunately, now late for her 75th birthday, although still very surprized and happy as wellI  Thank you x 3!', b'A great laptop for the money. Very fast and durable.

Great organization setup. Would buy again.", b'Carried this around the bahamas. It was splashed by pools and hottubs. Also carried through the rain in florida. A drink was also spilled on it. The laptop and tablet inside it were both protected and dry.', b'I am very disappointed  first day I am using this and the zipper is broken - perfect size but I am disappointed in the quality and hope I can return itI am updating this review as the seller has contacted me and is doing everything they can to make it right - that is customer service and I may re purchase this product as they are so helpfulMay 2017- UPDATE- I am using a newer version of the bag and the zipper has been MUCH IMPROVED.  I cannot say enough about the seller and their commitment to customer service.  They took the feedback about the zipper and fixed it - GREAT JOB love this backpack', b'Fairly comfortable, multiple compartments fit both my 14.1" laptop and 10" tablet pc, with chargers and other gears like hdmi cables, flash drives, etc. I live in an area where summer temperature easily goes over 95, so can\'t say much about the mesh- I\'d sweat with any backpack.. But the straps are sturdy enough to hold up the weight of my books, laptops, stationeries and water bottle, so that\'s great! I like the front little pocket to put things I could easily grab, like keys or earphones - things I\'d need to reach while on the go with things in my hands already.I have not had a chance to try out the usb port for the portable battery (not included), but I do think is a cool feature and is one of the reasons why I bought this bag.The lock that comes with the backpack works fine, haven\'t had a reason to put it to use yet; I figured it\'d be more useful in situations like travelling or having to leave your backpack in a public library while you go to the bathroom or something. But hey, free lock- use it for your gym locker if need be.All in all, a great, sturdy backpack with lots of different pockets in different sizes to make compartmentalizing your iteams fairly easy and convenient. Just what I needed!', b"I purchased this backpack only because a different model I wanted was sold out, and wasnt coming back into stock anytime soon. I cancelled the order, and was hesitant, but I liked how this bag looked, so i went for it. So happy I did. I had two backpacks before this, a small VANS bag with no pockets, and a bulky swiss gear with tons of compartments. I loved how the vans was small, and loved how the swiss had pockets, but this backpack is perfect. It's seriously the best of both worlds. It's a perfect size to hold things, but not so huge that its obnoxious to tote around. The front slanted pocket is perfect for quick finds like my gloves/ID for work, and the inside pockets are what I use for my wallet/phone. The included lock is meh, but it didnt really matter as I had bag locks anyway. The material feels strong and well made, and the zippers caught my attention. They're solid and wont break anytime soon. The side pouches are a nice touch for waters/things you need right away. It's stylish, functional, and despite having it for only a week, im in love with it. My only gripe with this bag is sometimes when you sling it over your shoulder, the straps adjust themselves/fall out of where you had them. It's a little annoying, but you learn how to avoid it. A perfect product that I would buy again. The included USB port for charging is such a nice touch that I didnt know I needed until I had it. I pair it with my cocoon grid it organizer and its perfect. Even full its bot heavy. Awesome awesome awesome bag!!", b'One of the best tech bags of 2017! The Mancro Innovation tech backpack is comfortable, spacious, has great built-in tech, and is affordable!', b'I had a more sporty sling bag before for work and the stitching was coming apart.  I was in need of a new bag and I like the look of this one .  I can fit all my stuff with room to spare and can fit folders or binders in the main pocket. This is usually a problem with the triangular shape of a lot of the sling bags. A great bag for the price.']}

For the price, I could not find a better value out there and I shopped around about 3 months. The processor is fast, there is a ton of RAM and a 1TB hard drive. I absolutely love it and have zero complaints. This is more than enough for the average and average + user. The free backpack has tons of padded pockets and zipper compartments. Highly recommend this set.", b"I'm using it as I write this review.  The screen is a little smaller than the previous HP that I gave to my wife although I was only one year old.  The New HP Bisiness Laptop is very fast, clear screen and plenty of space for my business.  I'm very pleased with quality I have received in my HP Laptops and would recommend them without reservation.", b"This laptop is a lot more powerful and useful than others seem to think - either they got it from faulty sellers or somehow the postage roughed theirs up, because it's a little beast for its price. 12 GB of RAM and a TB of space for only $500 is an amazing steal, and the fact that it has a quad-core processor and radeon graphics isn't anything to sneeze at either. This is the kind of little machine you'd get from your friend who works at HP who offers to build you a computer for $500, only it's straight from HP itself for the same price.I manage to play games with their highest settings that I couldn't on my old laptop, all while I have memory hogs like Chrome and Discord open in the background, and it's absolutely stunning.Plus, it comes with a nice mouse and a well-made backpack, both of which I get just as much use from as the laptop itself.", b'I bought this laptop for my 7-year-old nephew.  He really wanted to play Minecraft on a laptop after he attended Minecraft camp.  Came to find out that "regular" laptops don\'t support Minecraft due to the graphics.  Best Buy told me I would have to buy a gaming laptop between $800 to $1,000.  I asked my friend whose son builds computers and he found this and it works perfectly for what I want.  Minecraft downloaded easily and works great, there is room for more games to be downloaded, it is touch screen and, because he takes care of his stuff, this laptop will last him for years.  It also came with a mouse and a backpack.  I am pleasantly surprised and would highly recommend this computer.', b'It is fast, It is touch screen and it is a great deal. The seller did do a poor job of listing this item due to left out details. Once you get it you can look it up.  It is a real HP pavilion laptop. It does not run too hot. I am able to watch movies, play online games and do my work on this laptop. I do know computers very well and no this will not run graphics intense games that require a dedicated graphics card. Nor should you expect it to at this price point. The battery is removable so you can buy an extra  or upgrade it if it becomes a concern. Keys are crisp. Mouse pad is above average and the touch screen is just a crazy added bonus at this price. I have been using it for about a month without issue.', b"As with many HP products on Amazon.com, this one comes defective out of the box.Only 5 days old and it has stuck pixels on the screen.Stuck Pixels are ACTIVATED PIXELS that only show one colour: red, blue, green, white. If it is black then it is called a Dead pixel.Stuck pixels are easily noticeable on black or dark backgrounds/wallpapersFor anyone wondering: I rarely use the touch screen feature, PC has only been on for a considerable length of time during updates and the screen turns off during that time.I contacted HP, they suggested I return it to Amazon for a replacement, but Amazon doesn't accept replacement of this PC nor do they offer Tech Support.So am stuck combating HP tech support who want to distance themselves from the product. 2 hours and counting and still waiting for my warranty to be enforced.Therefore buy from 3rd party sellers at your own risk. (I already asked this seller about my warranty. will update about response)My first HP laptop from amazon suffered from:- WIFI failure before 6 monthsFIX:  Use USB tether through cell phone- Screen Failure around 9 monthsFIX: Use external monitor-  Keyboard failure at about 2 yearsFIX: Use external KeyboardBut this Laptop is for work, I just cant be lugging around a monitor whenever I need to use it.", b'This is a really great laptop.  Plenty of power to do what you want it to do, can even play some games on here.  I use mine for light gaming and graphic design.  One thing I dont like about this is the battery life.  Apparently its only a 3 cell battery and I have noticed I might get one, maybe two hours on a full charge and thats just basic use nothing intensive or taxing.  Other than that you cant beat this for the price!', b'Arrived quickly, had a scratch on the case (aesthetics don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me, but concerned about handling). Does not have Bluetooth connectivity (at least the one I got does not), which is frustrating; you have to purchase an adapter. Really fast. My biggest concern is that the box lists the RAM as 8GB, yet has 12GB, so I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming extra RAM was added. I\xe2\x80\x99m not complaining about the 12GB RAM, but it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a sketchy bc I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the legitimacy of the installer, manufacturer, etc. My number one biggest concern is the wireless network adapter which stopped working less than a month after purchase. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried all the troubleshooting I can, and my conclusion is maybe hardware failure. Really sucks but I\xe2\x80\x99ll purchase an external network adapter and I can still connect via Ethernet. Overall, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic deal for a decent computer and cool accessories. Will post update if network adapter issue changes.UPDATE 4/2/18:I promise it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an April Fool\xe2\x80\x99s joke, but next day upon reboot my network adapter was working properly. Hopefully continues to work!!! Added one star.']}

This is not a refurbished laptop. It is just used. Seller TECHarvard misrepresented this item. The power supply was broken and didn\'t work. The laptop body is damaged, dents and large scratches. I understand this is a previously owned laptop, but the product description says it will look and work like new. Not even close. I don\'t know who "certified" this refurbishment, but I have a very difficult time believing it was apple. Returning for a refund.', b'Its works okay as expected. I understand that I ordered a refurbished product but it was full of dents and scratches. Letters came off that we had to glue back. The picture that was advertised is not the same as what was delivered. Disappointed at this one.Update 9/14/17After purchasing this in August 2, it stopped working today. I would give 0 stars if I can. Support says return period ended Sept. 1.', b'Owned and configured by "Raleigh County School District"', b"Just received and doesn't even work Amazon should be ashamed  I had a blank screen since I powered it on", b'I purchased 4 of of these laptops.When I received them, one had an international keyboard, one had a broken mini port, and one of the chargers quit working after two days. What a horrible experience.', b"Basically it is an old version, yes. It doesn't work fast.But, I have changed RAM and HDD. I mean, I upgraded hardware.Put 16 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD. Now it is as fast as brand new macbooks. I may even claim that it is faster than new ones!So if you buy, upgrade it. That is it.", b"Buyer Beware. The first sign that something wasn't right was that this product is not being sold by Apple. I took my chances...tried to save some money. On arrival everything started fine, but definitely seemed pretty slow compared to our previous MacBook Pro. First sign of real trouble came when I downloaded Microsoft Outlook for my work e-mail. The computer couldn't handle it. Spinning beach ball time. Force quit (took a long time)... uninstalled Outlook and things went back to working, but remained slower than a normal Apple. Wife (already skeptical) told me to return it while it was still under Prime return policy. I balked. Held out (again being cheap). Computer worked well enough for about a month that I was OK with it for the cost savings being somewhat slow. Suddenly nothing worked. Literally you would move the trackpad (mouse) and the spinning beach ball would appear. Couldn't even scroll far enough to open a program without the beach ball endlessly spinning. Return policy became a little tricky. Fortunately the product was backed with a 90 day warranty. It took a couple call to Amazon customer service to: A) Return the product B) Get a full refund (they tried to apply a restocking fee). In the end was fully refunded which I appreciate greatly, but would not recommend purchasing.", b'Equipment totally defective, use it 02 times and then it did not turn on again. make the return of the product. has already been returned to the amazon warehouse in USAProduct Not recommended. bad']}

It seems pretty fast but I was using a 10 yr old Toshiba satellite with a brief moment with a Lenovo Idea pad (which was brand new and had a lot of problems with). I had this running in about 20 minutes out of the box. After that, it took 4-5 hours to customize with some additional programs. Then there were some updates. I've had it about 5 days now and it's had a few glitches which seemed to have corrected themselves. I think the speakers could be a little louder. The memory card reader worked fine as did the cd player when I added my wireless printer. I don't have any USB 3.0 cords so I haven't tried them yet but I'm sure they'll be fine.

This is supposed to be a new computer and there is a lock screen that's already started with someone's name on it and I need a password!!! So obviously not a new computer", b"Adequate memory, plenty of hard disk space, but slow to boot up and shut down. I replaced the hard drive with a solid state drive, and this took the laptop to a completely different level. However, opening the laptop to access the hard drive and RAM module required tech support from HP, which was prompt and concise. 4 screws were hidden under the rubber feet, so you'd have to unpeel them to remove the screws. Other laptop brands would just provide access doors to RAM and HD access. If you're going to upgrade this baby, you'd better do it at the same time, because cracking this thing open is not easy, and the damage that you can potentially do to the case can be visually distracting. I used a plastic guitar pick to pry the case open to prevent any denting, and it wasn't easy. 3 stars because of the difficult access, 5 stars if it came with a SSD."]}

The seller has listed it as a 2018 laptop.I contacted Dell tech support and was told that this laptop is beyond the exchange period because it was purchased 81 days ago, which was October 2017.  The agent suggested I mail it for service but a brand new laptop should not require service.  I am also noticing that the prompt freezes frequently when I am typing an email and it takes some time before the typed letters appear in rapid succession.  I need this laptop to run a couple of virtual machines so I am not sure how it will handle the workload.  I contacted the seller and received a response email with some kind of babbling not related to my concern at all. I sent another email a few days ago and received zero response this time.  A new laptop costing nearly $600 should not have issues and require service.  I have contacted Amazon to start a return but then decided to give this thing a chance, but if the noise and typing delays continue then I will send it back.', b'Overall, a very decent laptop. with touchscreen and backlit keyboardThere is a incorrect statement of the description: it does not have USB Type-C port; all it has is 1x SD card reader, 1x USB 2.0, 2x USB 3.1, 1x HDMI, 1x audio jack, and 1x ethernet jack. see image and details for Dell official website (new-inspiron-15-5000/inspiron-15-5570-laptop)Softwarewise: it does no come along with the 1 year McAfee anti-virus and MS Office 30 day trial as compared to the one purchase directly form Dell.It does have the 1 year limited warranty.', b'I had been sceptical about ordering a computer from Amazon, but I received a sealed dell box with a full 1yr international warranty (seller was issaquah highlands tech) . Everything is in working order, the screen is bright, and the build quality looks great.Given the specs and the price, I am 100% satisfied.', b'Pros: Faster than my old 2013 Asus laptop. The video quality is same as the old Asus laptop. Audio quality is better.Cons: Took 3 hours to get windows update while setting up the laptop for the first time. While using this laptop constantly hear this annoying "crackling" noise - maybe related to hard disk or fan - not sure.Having used an Asus laptop and now owing a Dell one -- if I have to make a choice in future --will buy an Asus one if the price is not that high. I don\'t see much quality difference between Asus and Dell - so why should anyone pay more for Dell?', b"Good one. Only downside is, it didn't have USB Type-C port, as mentioned in the description. It has finger print sensor though, which is not mentioned in the description.", b'Touch pad got all funky and "sticky" meaning when I move my finger over the pad, the cursor on the screen won\'t move with it. SUPER frustrating, seeing as it\'s only TWO months old. I\'ve updated every driver imaginable, spent hours on the phone with tech support and the issue was still not resolved. Buyer beware, do a quick google search and you\'ll find it\'s a common issue with Dell\'s. After several PC laptop purchases  and returns since January 2018, (2 Lenovo\'s, 1 HP, and this Dell) I\'m taking the plunge and buying a Mac. Too many issues with faulty PC hardware and Windows 10. The manufacturer\'s just can\'t seem to make a mid-range PC that runs well with Windows. Buh-Bye Windows, I want good hardware and software that work well together.', b'Because of the new technology, this 15.6 screen is very comparable to the 17" of my last Dell. Very happy with this computer. It\'s fast, the backlit keyboard is a nice feature and the touch screen is a big step up for me. I do wish, however, that there was a downloadable user\'s guide. The only manual I\'ve found online is related to taking apart and reassembling the computer. I need to  understand basics such as what are "sticky keys" and how/when to use them! There is also an occasional loud hum in the audio that I don\'t know to whom i should complain..', b'After shopping for months for a 15" laptop, in my price range, I finally decided on this Dell. I wanted an I5 processor with 8 g of Ram and this unit is perfect for me to run my business on. I use MS Office as a cloud based app so I\'m able to use this anywhere I have an internet connection. The screen size is easy to see and the keyboard feels good to type on. The best part for me is the keyboard is back-lit. For me I have to have a back-lit keyboard so I can type faster. Overall it is a very good value for the money in my opinion.']}

However, I consider this purchase is an unqualified success.For background, I do not need a personal laptop much except when I travel.  I build my own desktop PCs and I have a pretty robust rig in my man-cave for most needs at home, plus a HTPC in the family room.  I therefore don\'t want to sink a lot of money into something I only use occasionally.  On the other hand, knowing a thing or two about computers, I found the new offerings in the $300-$350 range to be pretty disappointing to say the least.  We\'re pretty much talking a cheaply built piece of flimsy plastic with 4GB of RAM and a clunky processor at that price point.  A prime example being the Acer piece of junk my new ThinkPad T430 is replacing.  So my conundrum was how to get prime rib performance and quality on a hamburger budget (and no, I\'m not a vegetarian!).My computer at work gave me the basis for my solution.  My work computer is a HP ProBook laptop that plugs into a docking station at work and I take it home on the weekends and some evenings.  I have had my current ProBook for about two years.  Being a government computer, it is pretty much clobbered with government software and connects via a sluggish network but with 8GB of RAM and an Intel i5 processor, it has performed as well as one could expect and has held up exceptionally well to daily use (nearly 7 days a week due to the nature of my job .. BTW, think about that the next time you sneer at civil service folks since some of us do have real jobs!).  So I started looking for recertified HP ProBooks and EliteBooks but after reading lots of reviews that compared them with Lenovo ThinkPads, I expanded my search to include those.  Although I have not had a ThinkPad since they were owned by IBM, the T430s looked like the best bang for the buck and so far, that seems to have been a very good call.So here is a summary of my mostly positive experience so far.  As some reviewers have mentioned, the computer arrives well packaged.  True statement and that\'s more than I can say about Amazon\'s outer box, which was way too big, allowing the inner box to move around a lot.  Fortunately, the inner packaging (highly recyclable, BTW) kept the computer snug and reasonably protected from shock.  I expected to see some wear and scratches and found none, zero, nada, zilch, goose-egg and null-set instances of blemishes.  The ruggedly superb build quality was clearly evident from the moment I opened the box. I nearly broke into a happy dance but fortunately thought better of it.The first boot-up was pleasantly uneventful.  Windows 10 ran its usual start-up wizards, giving me gentle prompts for WiFi connection, log-in to my Microsoft account, etc..  No drama there.  Once the initial set up was complete, Windows of course asked if I wanted to install updates.  Pro-tip:  say yes, since much of that are security updates but then expect the process to take a while (2 hours in my case since there was a big service pack involved).  It\'s worth it though.Once updated, I did the next thing I always do with a new laptop, namely embarking on a search and destroy mission for bloatware.  This was the only real surprise in the whole out-of-box experience.  Amazingly, no bloatware!  I went to the uninstall programs section in Control Panel and found maybe five items listed, all of which the laptop needed.  Pleasantly surprised, I moved on to load my personal apps and configure Windows the way I have it on my other computers.  No glitches and superb, smooth performance throughout. A word to the wise, although a computer "can" run Windows 10 on 4GB, I consider 8GB to be the minimum for decent performance.  I may upgrade to 16GB down the road but the performance I have seen so far puts that much lower on my to-do list.Looking ahead, I plan to upgrade the T430 to a SSD at some point.  For upgraders, the ease with which you can access the HDD and RAM was one of the big selling points for buying a corporate grade laptop.  In contrast, the Acer that I am relegating to the recycle bin required extensive disassembly and removal of the motherboard to access the RAM. No, really, I am not exaggerating!  Check YouTube.My ThinkPad T430 is clearly a keeper!Okay, so this would not be a proper Amazon review unless I found something negative to say, so this is the best I can come up with:1) Amazon needs to stop using trained bears in their packaging section.  Jeez!  I am glad I have that off my chest.2) A printed "quick-start" guide in the box would have been nice.  For instance, the day after initial start-up, I got the "Activate Windows" message on my desktop.  I am well used to this process on my desktop builds but I have not needed to do that on a newly purchased laptop before since they are typically pre-activated at the factory.  I briefly thought, "oh crap, here we go with unlicensed software," but to my relief, the authenticity label was right where it was supposed to be on the bottom.  However, what all purchasers might not notice is a "scratch-off" section obscuring part of the activation code.  I happened to notice that from experience but I am not sure everyone would.  With the complete activation code revealed, activation was a snap.  A couple page guide that covers "expectation management" kind of things such as the activation process, wouldn\'t be that hard or expensive, would it?  Come on, guys!3) While I hate bloatware and other unnecessary stuff occupying hard drive space, it would have been a nice touch to include the Lenovo User Manual on the hard drive (and pointed out in the aforementioned quick-start guide).  It\'s easy enough to download but it would have been a thoughtful inclusion.4) If you have read the other reviews, you probably already know the T430 does not have HDMI.  Not a deal-breaker for me and I\'ll probably buy an adapter just in case I need to connect to a HDMI display for some reason.  But if you absolutely must have HDMI installed, you\'ll need to look elsewhere. So there, I told you too.  But I think having 4 USB ports, 2 of which are USB-3, more than compensates since I never met a USB port I didn\'t like (and use).That\'s as close to negative as I can get.  Otherwise, my T430 and I are off to a great start.  Some users who look at a computer as an appliance may be put off by the lack of additional software.  No, this does not have Microsoft Office installed, so don\'t ask in Amazon\'s Questions and Answers section and you\'d probably get some clown telling you "I don\'t know" anyway.  Snarky comments aside, I cannot recommend this to someone absolutely lacking in computer skills and would suggest that those folks stick to their iPhones and tablets (still a bit snarky, huh?).  But for those in my situation who are not intimidated by the Windows 10 environment, can live without leading/bleeding edge technology but still want a durable and reliable laptop, you\'ve come to the right place.  The notable exception would be gamers and you poor suckers are going to have to plunk-down the big bucks for a gaming laptop if mobility is that important to you.  Hint: Desktops still have a role and gaming is one of the reasons!So with the above caveats noted, the Lenovo ThinkPad T430 gets five stars and my strongest recommendation. This piece of cyber prime rib is delicious!', b'The product was supposed to have a built-in webcam. There is none.', b'This is a clean refurbished laptop.  HDD indicates 12330 hours, and 1300 power on count.  (CrystalDiskInfo)  So the drive has been around the block a few times.  My first purchase attempt through Blazing Prices was a dud.  It had a damaged right rear USB port, as if someone had wrenched a drive from the port.  Amazon Prime was great and after contacting them I had a return label and my replacement was on the way.  Amazon Prime is great - painless returns.When the replacement arrived, here\'s what I got:Pros:  Clean refurbish job.  I had to clean a few keys of what looked like a little peanut butter.  No big deal., Other than a few scuffs on the lid, everything looks good.  The keyboard is nice and responsive with no worn keys.  The speed is fine for office level tasks, Youtube, and social media.  I may upgrade the HDD in the near future for an added speed boost and a little more peace of mind, especially given the age of the drive.Cons:  The computer was advertised to come with a webcam.  Neither one I got from Blazing Prices had a webcam.  I will have to buy an external webcam to make up for that deficiency.  Also, the battery lasts about 30 minutes.  Which is unacceptable.  I have already ordered a replacement battery through a different Amazon vendor.Overall, I am ok with it the quality.  It\'s a T430 Lenovo - which is a pretty bullet proof laptop.  So, in the interest of getting back to work I am going to stick with it and make it work.Blazing Prices sent several emails asking if I could "find it in my heart" to leave them good feedback.  This was AFTER a week of going round and round with them.  When I first reached out to them, I explained that my first attempt had been returned through Prime, and the second laptop had no webcam and a defective / dying battery,  They initially offered to make things right by offering to reimburse for a replacement but never gave specifics.  How / who do I send this one back?  Will the next one have a decent battery and a webcam?  No response.  They said "keep the item" in one email, then asked in another email they asked if I had returned it.  Worse, there is no continuity in a conversation with them.  Each email you send appears to go to a different representative.  "David" sent some official looking emails asking for feedback, but when I responded to his email, my inquiries went right back into the till with an automated response followed by a foggy response from a rep.  My last response from them was borderline sarcastic, and still offered no solution.If you don\'t need a webcam and you don\'t mind buying a replacement battery, and you have Amazon Prime to ensure a painless replacement if the PC is damaged, this is OK.  You might want to shop around to a different vendor.  I hope to get a lot of miles out of the computer, but I have no trust in Blazing Prices anymore.', b'Was not paid for review.  Needed another laptop for my business where I need to travel frequently.  Laptop arrived like new.  For Windows 10, and Microsoft Office, and Internet, works like my brand new and more expensive Lenovo (just had to sacrifice less then a half-inch in depth.)  Still very compact, very sturdy, and I think easier to type on.  Replaced the battery and lasts over 6 hours on a charge with basic Office use.Great computer and amazing price.  Highly recommend for business.']}

The lap desk is very light, it truly feels like half a pound at most. The top of the desk is nice, I got the wood finish and it is a dark wood color. It fits my 15 inch laptop. It also is big enough to have a cool laptop tray underneath the laptop and not look crappy or overcrowded. The portion for the mouse is exactly the same as a mouse pad. The slot for the phone or tablet is big. I have an iPhone 7 plus with a defender otterbox case, it fits with a little room. You can leave the phone and it won't fall, however, I wouldn't leave it in there if you move the desk. I fell like it could still fall out. But if it's on the side, it should have a better chance on staying in the slot. The bottom of the lap desk is so comfortable and soft. The pillow cushions feel similar to a hacksack or like a beanbag. I also feel as if the cushions don't retain a lot of heat given off by my lap, that makes this desk a lot more comfortable.  It is nearly 2feet wide and around a foot long. I would definitely recommend buying this product.", b'It is a good concept, but needs work in my opinion. It is light weight and has plenty of room. I like the separate area for the mouse and holder for your phone. However, they do not work as designed;1. It leans too far forward, due to the different sized pads underneath.2. The mouse pad area needs some type of raised bumper or border, as the mouse is constantly sliding off the desk and falling every time I move.3. The phone holder is not deep enough, so the phone is constantly falling out or over, and not wide enough to put your phone in sideways.', b'I really, really wanted to love this product because of the stellar reviews but it has horrible design flaws. The front and back "bumpers" that rest on your lap are different sizes. What does this do? Well, when you put it on your lap it leans VERY far forward towards you. So every time you take your hand off the mouse to type something the mouse slides down off the board on your couch. The laptop is leaning so far towards you the keyboard is at a very awkward angle to type anything. In addition, the "phone holder" is comical; it\'s only about deep enough to hold a saltine cracker, so basically, a normal smartphone that includes a protective case barely fits in it and is at high risk to fall or tip out of it.Hope this was helpful---I returned my unit for all of these reasons.', b'I love this laptop desk. I work from home when I\'m not feeling well, and this lap desk is awesome. I just got a larger lap top, and it didn\'t fit the lap desk I had. This one works well!  When closed my laptop measures 15" x 10". Diagonally it measures 17". There is room to spare AND the laptop doesn\'t encroach on the built in mouse pad! The pads underneath are adequately filled, and balances perfectly on my lap. My husband wants one now. Of course he does, I make this thing look good! :)', b'I like this LapDesk a lot.  It fits my 17" laptop just right and plenty of room on the attached mouse pad for my mouse.  My cell phone fits fine in the slot.  I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 because of the pillows that support the LapDesk.  This desk would be perfect if it had a memory foam bottom.  The back pillow is higher in the back than the front.  As a result, it tends to feel uneven on my lap and with the weight of the laptop, tends to tip a little backwards.  I sometimes keep my free hand on the front of the desk to balance it the way I like it to sit.  The pillows feel a bit on the hard side and with the weight of the laptop, it can feel just a little heavy and uncomfortable.  The design does allow for the heat to not get to your legs.  For my personal preference, a softer, memory foam on the bottom would make this ideal.  I am thinking of returning and trying one with memory foam.', b'I don\'t have a laptop, but I do have a wireless keyboard/mouse that I use with a standard PC connected to my television, so I picked up the Deluxe Laptop Lap Desk so I wouldn\'t have to try to balance the mouse on the edge of the sofa and put the keyboard on my lap. Here\'s my thoughts:- The lap desk is lightweight, without feeling "cheap". There is a 5" raised bar at the bottom to prevent a laptop/book/keyboard from sliding off, which is handy for a wireless keyboard.- The surface is a laminate that does a fair job of appearing as wood. Although it\'s smooth, there is just a bit of surface friction to help keep items from sliding.- The built-in mouse pad works well, although it\'s narrower than I would like. Making it a bit wider would have been nice, but even with a lap desk as wide as this one, space is limited. The pad does not appear to be replaceable, so I\'m a little worried what this is going to look like in a year when it\'s had some use, spills, etc. It also hangs on to pet hair pretty well, so be ready for frequent picking if you\'ve got a hairy beast that sits nearby!- There is a shallow tray at the top to rest a cell phone in, which works fairly well. Moving the desk around or shifting my legs doesn\'t dislodge the phone, and the angle allows easy viewing of the phone without cutting off the bottom.- The leg pads are fabric and filled with small pellets to wrap around your legs while the lap desk is in use. They appear to be permanently attached, and there does not seem to be any way a user could replace the pellets if needed a a future point in time. They are very comfortable, and you hardly notice the contact when in use (although with the heavier weight of a laptop, this could be a different experience).All in all, I\'d recommend this if you need a lap desk for a wireless keyboard/mouse or laptop. The quality is good, and it\'s appearance is subtle enough with the dark colors that you can leave it out when it\'s not on your lap and it blends into the room.']}

I followed the instructions exactly as to fully charging the battery pack and allowing it to discharge down to 7% for the first 3 times before actually using the computer.  I think this stuff is very important as the battery would discharge quickly down to 7% which had me worried about the battery life. However, after performing 3 consecutive discharges to 7%, the battery life is a little over 4 hours which I am very pleased with!!!', b'Arrived early and was 91% charged.  Snapped perfectly into my 1545.  Followed the instructions about cycling from full charge before use and then recharging when discharged down to 7%.  Works like a champ.', b'only had it a few days but was fully charged ready to go and with the new cord I also bought with plug into computer that fit and stayed tight has put new life into my old computer. Very pleased and a great value.', b"It fit my old Dell laptop and has been working great. I honestly didn't expect it to work as well as it has been.", b'Since this is a battery, it will take at least one charge cycle before I can provide an actual review on product quality. This review will be updated once I have had time to truly test the product.That being said....Pros:Delivered on time and in good condition.Nice / fair price point for this product.Contained instructions / first charge cycle / usage card that (and this is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT) is legible with large print, grammatically  correct and in English. I have purchased WAY too many electronics I could not read the instructions (even with magnification) and those that I could magnify where in broken English and not easily followed.Cons:If there are any, I will modify this review.', b"So far so good. Replaced the factory battery in a Dell laptop with this one and the computer recognized it without any problems at all. I'm getting anywhere from 2.5 to 3 hours or so of life out of this batter on a full charge and that is about what I would expect. Of course that is with continuous use. It sure beats the heck out of spending 4 or 5 times as much for a direct factory replacement. Quality is top notch. It seems just as well built as the factory original. I can't tell the difference. So far so good.", b"Working good so far on old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1545. I'm also using a new Dell PA-21 65Watt Adapter for it, which is same as old stock Adapter. The new battery didn't recognize the old adapter so I was lucky enough to find same one on Amazon \xf0\x9f\x98\x80", b'Purchased for a several year old Dell Inspiron. The computer is seldom used but battery life never was very good. To be fair it may not have been "seasoned" properly, but in last year or two, life was down to about 10 minutes. The new battery has restored life to two and a half hours or more. Needless to say, quite happy with it.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

Honestly, I do. The case was great and fit my Toshiba Satellite snug and securely. Plenty of pockets for the mouse, USB cords, the charger, etc. Plenty of room. Life was good.Then it happened. The strap unclipped itself while I was leaving my office this afternoon. You see, they are intended to be free spinning, typical straps. Except when it doesn\'t twist, it will come off. Another review I read mentioned this. "Nah, that\'s just a once in a blue moon scenario" I told myself after reading it. I shuddered the same phrase as I watched the case fall corner first. Not even enough time to realize what had happened, as it was only hanging from my shoulder....Opened the bag to find my 850 dollar laptop with a dented frame and shattered screen. That was hours ago, and now here I am. Return processed and a backpack ordered. Just get a backpack, It\'s not worth the risk to your electronics. There isn\'t enough padding. Learn from my mistakes! Look at the carnage and don\'t let it happen to yours!!', b'This bag has two significant problems that really should be addressed.Firstly, the padding is insufficient in the bottom corners.  There is enough padding at the bottom and sides, but almost no padding at the corners, which are the most vulnerable points on your laptop.Secondly, the shoulder strap attaches to the bag with two plastic clips, and they can let go when least expected, especially when the strap was a little twisted before picking it up.  This has happened to me on multiple occasions.The combination of these two problems has led to my laptop suffering corner damage from falling onto pavement when I picked up my bag by the strap, and it decided to let go.If you have a nice laptop, this is an accident waiting to happen.', b'At first it seemed to be amazing . So thought wow amazon great job , full of padding and somewhat full of protection. well to my surprise as i was walking with my laptop on campus the strap broke off and the bag fell on the floor . damaging badly my new laptop. i can say i was very upset. its a good bag but Amazon please make a better job with the strap', b"i don't understand the negative reviews of the 11.6 inch size.  They must have changed the design.IMO, if the carrying strap is fastened properly with the hook facing outward (the listing photo and most people hook it backward,) that hook won't become detached without breaking it.  If you are still concerned, get a strap at Goodwill for an old time 10# laptop carrying case.Swing the case by the straps with a 5 pound load inside, or drop it without the laptop properly inserted, and the impact with wall or ground could be substantial.  No soft side case can absorb a point impact.  It has no way to distribute them, so I don't recommend this case for expensive contents or that weighs more than 3 pounds.  A $300 or less Chromebook should be ok.There is 1/2 of padding on the pocket side and 1/4 over the rest of the case. Insert a laptop hinge side first with the display side facing the front. Put the laptop in the center section of the largest compartment and there's room to insert a magazine or paper pad on either side for more impact resistance. A child could fit homework in those side sections.I'm happy with what I got today,  but will amend this review if anything changes after a few months of abuse.Here's a comparison of the plastic hook, one from an old $120 Dell Laptop case, and one from a new $85 messenger bag.", b'The shoulder strap on the bag simply popped loose one day, causing my laptop to make fast friends with the concrete and breaking the laptop.', b"I LOVE this bag.  Right now I keep my MacBook Pro, 2nd gen iPad, a kindle touch, all the charging gear, and still have room to throw in my bulky planner when I need it. With all that, it's still sleek and lightweight. I bought a little case for my wireless ear buds so I can clip it to the side and it's the perfect setup. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JB1LGTI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_19", b'I haven\'t had much real world usage for the bag yet but here are my preliminary thoughts.I purchased this for my 15" Acer Chromebook.  The size if perfect for the Chromebook.  The zippers appear relatively sturdy enough for the purpose and the extra pockets are nicely size for carrying documents, smaller items, etc...  The strap also appears to be sturdy enough and the plastic clips look like they hold up.Padding - here is why I am only giving 4 stars.The size padding is good but the bottom padding is a bit lacking.  This is really the only fault I see is the lack of padding on the bottom and bottom\\sides.I had a piece of foam I cut down, placed at the bottom and now I think the Chromebook will be a bit better protected.Overall I think that the bag is very good and just a bit more padding would give it the extra star.', b"This review is about the 14 Inch AmazonBasics Laptop BagThis is a good budget laptop case. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 fits perfectly along with the computer charger and extra phone chargers. It does what I need with a price tag I like.PROS: For carrying around and storing a feather weight Chromebook, a couple chargers, and sometimes my Kindle, it gets the job done. It has a ton of pockets and the bag itself is really lightweight. It's inexpensive. It's simple.CONS: This doesn't feel like the most expensive bag on the market, and as other reviewers stated, it could have some more padding. This would not be a good choice for someone who travels for work, the plastic clips and minimal padding simply won't stand up against baggage claim on a regular basis. This would also be a poor choice a Macbook Pro or any other fancy laptop. Just use good judgement-- if you plan on spending 1K+ on a laptop, prepare on spending more than $16 on a laptop bag."]}

A moderate gaming laptop that doesn\'t scream "I GAME!" was a necessity for me, and the power of the GTX 1050 is solid for most modern titles.  The Vivobooks from Asus have VERY important sub-models, and this one (DB74T) has the supremely important screen spec: an IPS with 72% NTSC and 100% sRGB color gamut.  There exists many variants with the TN panel and you\'ll find many online reviews warning about how this screen ruins an otherwise great laptop.Battery life is a little sub-optimal compared to it\'s competition, but I rarely am not plugged in so not a concern for me.  It does come with some bloatware that is easily remedied as well, so no marks off overall.  The touchscreen is nice but something that I don\'t really use (as of yet) but having it as an option is nice.  The only real complaint I have is the headphone jack is right side of the laptop sometimes in the way since I frequently game with a mouse (never could use the touchpad) on smaller workspaces.  Time to go with a wireless headset I guess!If you don\'t care about gaudy, chunk, "gaming" visuals I think this laptop is about mid-pack.  But, if you want a clean, polished, professional looking machine that can handle itself in recent titles, this should be at the top of your list to consider.', b'Pros:+Great value for money, i7 8550u performs around 5% worse than i7 7700hq in all core situations while consuming MUCH less power (15W vs 45W). The single thread speeds and clockspeed of the i7 8550u are faster than i7 700hq though so it feels extremely snappy when doing normal stuff like word/powerpoint/web browsing (single core applications)+GTX 1050 just makes it even better+IO selection is great as long as you don\'t rely on thunderbolt.+Decent screen on the IPS model(core i7 8th gen)+++Very good and loud speakers which do not peak at all even when playing opera music. Bass is clear even for electro music which is really impressive. Little distortion (at 17inches its inexcusable for a laptop to have that). Not as good as macbook pro 2017 speakers but still way better than most windows laptops.+Heat is exhausted out the sides which are some distance away from the keyboard so the keyboard does not get hot.+keyboard is nice to type on and I could easily get up to 100wpm.+only a few bloatware, 10mins of uninstallation should do the trickCons:-VERY bad battery life even with the more efficient i7 8550u, getting around 4.5 hours of normal web browsing on a full charge. I feel this is a design flaw rather than a compromise since most of the space inside the laptop is empty instead of being used for more battery capacity.EDIT TOOK A STAR OFF:I thermal tested the computer by stressing the i7 with folding@home, and on 100% load, the processor boosts up to 3.8ghz. However in just 10s it hits 90C/194F and throttles down to 3.1ghz so as to not damage itself. Thermal throttling of this level should not be present in a laptop this big and this is a HUGE performance drop. Furthermore ASUS, unlike most other laptop brands, places a "warranty void if broken" sticker on the cpu hotplate, so YOU CANNOT CHANGE THERMAL PASTE WITHOUT VOIDING THE WARRANTY.', b'Edit* (1/24/2018):Now that Amazon has actually published this review, here are a few edits and recaps [the original review is more thorough]:-Apparently I was mistaken: you have to purchase Windows 10 Pro separately if you want Pro, there is no free upgrade (at least none I could find). Otherwise W10 Home has remained satisfactory. It was always a fast OS, still is, programs open quickly, switching from one to another and between tabs is as seamless as on a desktop, and the power on-through-BIOS-to-login screen time is less than ten seconds, I\'d say. I don\'t know if Microsoft finally stopped making constant updates, but I haven\'t noticed any update interruptions in the last 2 weeks. Maybe they decided to stop torturing people with forced updates. Maybe the laptop has be waking itself up in the middle of the night and installing while I sleep. IDK.-I am loving this Intel chip. Quite possibly the single component responsible for making this laptop deserving of 5 stars. I have NEVER had as good a laptop experience as this. You pay a premium for Intel, but I\'m content that you get the bang for your buck (I say this having only ever used AMD for desktops). Usually the CPU never gets over about 50-55 Centigrade during 1080p 60 fps video watching in Chrome and Firefox, and is often in the middle 40s to high 30s with simple tasks and when idle. Occasionally during multi-tasking it will spike as high as 66-68 Centigrade, but usually only for a second. The fan is rather obvious in sound, but unless you\'re watching really quiet video, you won\'t notice it when it does kick on, usually only above 50 degrees. ASUS and Intel say the 8550U goes up to 4.0 GHz, but I haven\'t seen it go past 3.8-3.9 GHz on this unit. I have however seen it dip significantly below 1.8 GHz, as low as 1.15 GHz and even less than 1.0 GHz. I\'m unfamiliar if laptops normally do this to conserve power and extend the chips lifespan, but I imagine it does. Haven\'t run into thermal throttling, but have discovered something else from Intel\'s monitor; this does "current limit throttle", which is new to me. Maybe a limitation from the battery and amperage of the power supply even plugged in? Never heard of it before; it does occasionally throttle for a second, but not for extended periods even while under the same load.-The speakers are awesome. The onboard audio is very good in general, and I don\'t know if I\'d be able to tell the difference between it and my desktop SoundBlaster ZXR unless they were side by side with identical headphones. I recommend setting the "Audio Wizard" controller to the [Music] option and tweaking the bass and treble up a bit. I haven\'t fiddled around with decibel modulation in the frequency options, but it\'s there for anyone to use. The speakers are good enough to be from a TV.-Again, I emphasize that the keyboard is rather far set into the chassis, and it really isn\'t comfortable. I may invest in some wrist rests, small enough to fit on the laptop, I don\'t bother with the track pad. The keys are alright, a bit flat, but it\'s a laptop, so I\'m not put off. If I want, I could always just plug in a USB keyboard and type in my lap. I use a USB mouse (Logitech G600) and haven\'t had any glitches.-General I/O, system drivers, and other odds and ends are nicely hands off. No silly stuff like having to download Realtek ethernet drivers, a problem I had with an older ASUS motherboard. This unit has sufficient NVIDIA drivers, including GeForce Experience to get to the most recent drivers for the 1050; audio is good to go, wireless/bluetooth, etc etc. I\'m very glad ASUS has this stuff covered.-I still like the screen. Blacks are nice and black, a fact that makes a big difference. Nice colors, no flickering or tearing, no problems. I certainly hope that it lasts until this unit is hilariously obsolete.-One important note: I still have not tested any games, or anything else that would use the 1050. I\'m going to download a 13.5 GB game soon to both test the CPU and SSD a bit more, and eventually the 1050 graphics processor. Based on my experience with the 1060 desktop from EVGA, I don\'t think I\'ll be let down. At some point I also want to see if this unit can output 4K UHD (at 30 fps I assume?) like ASUS claims it can, and maybe even 1080p 144 Hz if I can turn off the built in display.-Probably one of the few annoying/bad things I can complain about is that the power button is placed right about the minus "-" key on the numpad, so it\'s pretty easy to mistakenly hit it.All things said, I\'ve given it a new, but still tentative, 5 stars. Thanks for building a good machine, ASUS!Original review* (1/11/2018:So upfront I will say I dislike laptops. They often have terrible quality control from manufactures, they either overheat or perform poorly, and the batteries run dry like the Sahara. This purchase is one of the most nerve-wracking, extremely considered, over analyzed processes I\'ve ever had the (dis)pleasure of subjecting myself to. Looking at Dell battery recalls, HP costumer satisfaction holes, and yes, even lukewarm waters for ASUS and Acer laptops (usually due to QA conflicting with high prices)...I have been questing for a laptop that can satisfy the avarice of an enthusiast desktop user, me.My first two hour experience with this model has been....suspiciously equitable. To cover some of the basics:-Windows 10 Home, preinstalled, has not been horrible. I disabled everything I hate about W10 and deleted all that apps I didn\'t want within about ten or fifteen minutes. The OS is fast like it was when I used it a year or two ago on a desktop test. A+, most things considered. I still wish it would let me have a 40-50 character password for login. Maybe the free upgrade to Pro will get me there. That said, ASUS doesn\'t provide a physical copy. Lame, but whatever. Said more, there is almost no paperwork with this laptop; a warranty booklet and a short user guide. Straight to business I guess.-Herein lay my first issue, regarding the OS; there is no disk drive on this model. Not the be-all-end-all, I can probably copy Windows 8 to a flash drive and boot to it from BIOS if W10 starts driving me crazy......if I can figure out how to get to the ASUS BIOS....again, this is just 2 hours into using, so we\'ll see where things go.-Restarts/boots are quite fast for a laptop. Very appreciated. Programs are fast too. No annoying lagging when opening a program like on older laptops, particularly duo core models. I\'m liking my first experience with Intel.-My first "stress test" for any computer is as follows: as quickly as I can and as simultaneously as I can, install Chrome and Firefox, download and install new NVIDIA drivers and the requisite CPU overclocker/monitoring program (which, from Intel, I quite like first impressions), login to Chrome, sync, and watch a YouTube video in 1080p 60 FPS, open task manager and compare the CPU clock speeds to the monitoring utility program. All of this went very well. This Intel CPU is quadcore, has excellent low clock speeds, and hasn\'t gotten over 41-42 Centigrade during all of this stressing. Speeds in the task manager match those in the utility. So far so good. It feels like desktop performance, which is thrilling.-The screen: very nice. This 17" model is excellent; I like the color vibrance, the bright whites are intense, the blacks are very black (aside from a tiny bit of backlight leak in, so far as I\'ve noticed, the bottom left corner; this is not worse than my ASUS monitor, which I love, so no issue for me personally, after all, this isn\'t an OLED screen or anything), and the easy access to screen brightness is keyboard functional, very awesome. Windows 10 also has a color corrector option in the settings that reduces blue light and increases red light at night, I quite like it. On desktops I usually use the program f.lux for this, and for now they seem relatively similar in performance. ASUS also say this screen already has reduced blue light, so kudos. My eyes are saved!-In line with the keyboard brightness control, the general UI has been pleasant. The keys for now are unfamiliar, but I\'m typing this review on the laptop and it has been just fine. Given how verbose I am, it\'s a good test of extended use. One negative is that the keyboard is set what must be approaching 4 inches into the width of the chassis, so my forearms aren\'t comfortable to rest on it. The key presses however are fine, have a satisfying travel distance, and the backlit keyboard is a first for me; can\'t say as I\'ll get more use out of it than the lowest brightness setting. The trackpad is...a trackpad. I prefer a mouse. There are no "buttons", so I mush things a bit when trying to use it two handed/ two fingered, but if you\'re used to trackpads it\'ll be no problem I suppose.-Moving onto IO. It\'s excellent, and one of the biggest factors into why I bought this model. Plenty of USB, SD, HDMI, and even a glorious ethernet jack, and a headphone/mic jack. The DC power jack isn\'t as solid feeling as I would like, but that\'s because I\'m used to power cords that plug into PSU\'s that weigh as much as this laptop.-Speaking of power, it seems quite well supplied on this unit; I haven\'t run the battery down to 5% and then timed full charge, but ASUS boasts quick charging. Power players probably won\'t see past 3 hours of use on battery alone, I haven\'t even played any games to test how power hungry the GTX 1050 is, but moderate use (just by my initial experience) probably spans into 5-6 hours, and I imagine 10-12 hours could be achieved with skilled power management and task stringency. I pulled the plug after full charge, and the battery estimate says I have almost 4 hours left after an hour already spent unplugged. I\'m very happy with this.For now, I suppose that\'s all I\'ll say. The unit is quiet, the fans are reasonable when the CPU is working, the HDD or something makes some soft clicking/chirping when working (though, thankfully, the OS and everything is installed on the SSD, which I\'m liking the speeds on), but it\'s not really any different than the occasional noise I get from my desktop or have heard from a usual laptop. The unit is almost entirely cool to the touch, save for the bottom at the front and the top center at the front. I imagine that\'s where the CPU/GPU/heatsinks and pipes are.As I said to begin, I tend to dislike, even hate laptops. This ASUS however has been a wonderful experience thus far. Fast. Responsive. Quiet. Performing. Beautiful display. Oh, and yes, quite lovely onboard sound, at least through my Senheiser headphones. The speakers seem rather quiet, but I haven\'t tested them at all, so I\'m probably mistaken about hat.4 stars for first impressions. If it keeps up, I\'ll probably give this thing 5. I will update probably within a month.']}

I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

This is one of the best bargain laptop I\'m owned.  Two things I don\'t like is the cut and paste with the built in touchpad.  It doesn\'t let you do that.  You have to use the keyboard.  If you use an external mouse, then you can use the right click.  Second, reading files on an SD card is very slow.  Hard to view your pictures to upload.Using it right now and we love it!  It\'s fast for what we do.  Great bright screen and really nice speakers.  It\'s lightweight and not bulky.  I can\'t use those smaller screen size 10" to 13" so this a perfect.  17" is just too big.  The wifi is fast!  My high school kids tested it and they said its perfect for their school work.  They use google docs, drive to do their homework.  Gmail is perfect along with hangout!  Anyways, the price is also awesome!  Battery life is long and if you need more storage, just pop in a usb flash drive.  No need for me to upgrade to Linux.  The only problem I see is the network printing.  My network printer might not be supported in google print.  They can print on the desktop pc.  This is way better than tablets which is so hard to type.  So happy I took a chance and bought this.  Anyways, price jumped a little since I bought it.  But this is definitely worth it!  I\'ll buy a couple more for my family.Update:  Just bought a couple more.  This is a nice laptop with awesome battery life.  Much longer battery life than my tablet.  I figured out cloud print and can now print so I got this for the family.  It\'s not for gaming but productivity.  My high school kids are very familiar with google apps so this is an easy transition and no need to install linux.', b'This is my first experience with a Chromebook and the the whole Google based system, so I have been looking forward to learning just what is better with a Chromebook and what isn\'t so good.  My impressions so far:Out of the box, except for the charging unit, it was impossible to tell this was a refurbished computer.  Basically it looks new.  Upon lifting the lid, the screen activated and immediately displayed the background.  It was simple to enter my router passcode and within seconds I was online with Chrome browser!  Peformance-wise, this thing is lightening fast upon initial browsing, but does show some lag after having a few dozen websites under its belt.  It certainly performs very well on YouTube - as one would expect, and for what most computer users "use" a computer for these days, I\'d say it\'s every bit the equal of any other type.Having a rather small, 16GB SSD HDD, it the intent is to take advantage of Google\'s amazing array of cloud storage options, all of which I\'ve already been using on my iMac and HP laptop.  Personally, I\'m a BIG FAN of the concept of online storage where data can be accessed from any point in the  world by simply logging into one\'s account.  In fact, while I was pondering downloading the HP software for printer setup, I realized there is no need since my HP printer has an email address...simply email the document to be printed and out it comes...from anywhere on Earth!  So this is certainly the way forward and what I wanted to learn from a Chromebook is whether it\'s viable, or clunky and unreliable.  Well, from what I can tell, cloud storage and usage beats storing gigabytes of data on a local drive with all the cost and headache that goes into maintaining backups to save the data WHEN the hard drive/storage solution fails.Another thing I like...this thing is LIGHT...and thin.  It\'s large considering it\'s a 15.6" screen, but I feel a great comfort knowing there are no moving mechanical parts inside to bump and grind against one another if I need to pick it up and walk around!  Another reason for having SSD instead of a classic platter hard-drive that is guaranteed to fail right about the time you haven\'t backed it up in awhile.Okay, so the downside....must be one right?  I guess the downside is that it can\'t run all the myriad of Window\'s based programs and games, and basically nobody is making versions of said games specifically for Chromebook.  For example, one cannot run GTA-V on Chrome...but then, here comes the shocking surprise, Goggle\'s chrome OS is basically LINUX!  Naturally there are all sorts of instructibles on the internet as well as videos, showing one how to create a "side-by-side" Chrome/Linux operating system, thus allowing the use of the massive universe of Linux programs, including Window\'s emulators that will allow one to run GTA-!  Okay...well, with THAT little tidbit of knowledge about the chrome OS, I\'m a total convert!  EVERY Windows computer I own has a Linux partition with dual boot capability, so the ability to do the same with chrome, only make it a simple hot-key swap is pretty sweet!As for local storage....naturally one can hook up to a massive, stationary hard drive to store data locally, or use a much smaller external drive, or even SSD external drive, or flash card...which means a LOT of date stored on highly secure and reliable media!I was thinking when I purchased this model I should have gotten about five....now I\'m thinking I\'ll do that.As for reliability...well, I\'ve only had it a few days...it\'s a refurbished unit, and I\'m sure my wife will enjoy telling me how stupid it was to save $400 on a Chromebook it if happens to have a problem in the next few months, and we\'ll see how that goes.  One of the reasons I buy from Amazon is the immediate support!This is an excellent buy...I just hope nobody else takes the chance on it before I can snatch up a few more!UPDATE:I liked this Chromebook so much I bought a second for my other son!  And, I\'m about to buy ANOTHER for my daughter to use in school!Why?  Simple...PRICE-VALUE!  For the money, both of the units I have purchased have come looking virtually brand new, and function as brand new.  Playing with the Chromebook got me serious about exploring Google\'s spate of online productivity tools and now I\'m a convert.This model is extremely light and thin with outstanding battery life.  I spent an entire day with one and only managed to use up half the battery.  No these are not suitable for those seeking a "gaming machine" but then they cost about 1/10th of what such a computer costs, yet are perfect for SCHOOL work!For those who think they must have a Windows system for College work in order to have APA Perrla, think again...all that is now ONLINE and can be accessed ONLINE just as Google\'s documents program!  So there really is ZERO need for a monster hard drive for a school oriented machine.Another thing this Chromebook does just fine is "cruise the internet."  One can watch Youtube videos all day long with no problem, browse web pages and frequent forums.For those who want more local storage...fine, pop in a thumb drive to hold all those photos and home videos!All-in-all, these little gems are the "real steal" in every possible way.  Thankfully there are plenty of status conscious, "early adopters" who pay the "new" price so the rest of us can pay the "refurbished" price.  Again, this thing is 100% solid-state which means zero moving parts....pretty rugged unless one is deliberately trying to smash it.', b"I bought this chromebook for school and relaxing, and I chose to get this refurbished model to save money. My mother also has one, and we both love it! As soon as I got it, I switched to developer mode so I can use the Google Play Store, works amazing!Hardware: Best speakers on all of my 3 laptops, which is amazing since one of my laptops was $850. The screen is pretty good for the price. The keyboard is very comfortable to type on. The trackpad is very smooth and accurate, much better than my windows computers. The build is plastic, but there's no creaking, and it is light enough to carry in my backpack without hurting my spine.Software: With only 2gb of ram and the fact that its in developer mode, it still runs perfectly! It even ran some games well from the Google Play Store. I love chrome OS, perfect for school work and play.Will update this review later.", b"Awesome buy! I never had a Chromebook before. I have many PC's and built most of those so the concept of the Chromebook was a curiosity I needed to investigate. I bough this to give to my father who has become frustrated with his laptop. All the updated and slow performance just made it necessary to look at options. The Chromebook was the right choice. Because of the simplified OS, the processor isn't burdened with all of the overhead like you see with PC's. Of course, this is a Chromebook so you can't install programs made for PC's but you can install many apps from the play store. For most people this is all that is needed, in my fathers case it is exactly what he needed. This was a refurbished unit and mine arrived looking as good as new. No scratches or blemishes. I could not be more pleased. I was saddened to see people complain about the inability to install software. This is not a Windows PC so if you don't know what that means, please do some homework before you buy this. If you understand what a Chromebook is, I highly recommend this one. At this price you will be hard pressed to find a better performer with a screen big enough to actually enjoy.", b'My wife and I purchased this computer for my mom and she loves it. It is perfect for her as she mainly goes online and sends pictures from her camera.She loves how fast and easy it is.']}

Came very clean. Came installed with Windows 10. Very pleased with the machine, the professionally installed operating system and drivers and the overall cleanliness and condition of the machine', b"An I5 with 8 Gb of memory for $200? How can you pass up a deal like that?Supposedly refurbished. I don't know about that. The one I received looked brand new.I couldn't find a scratch or blemish anywhere. It doesn't look like it had ever been used.Win7 or Win10? I have no idea. I never booted into windows. First thing I did was to replacethe Seagate drive with a Samsung SSD, and then installed Antergos/Arch Linux with KDE desktopThis machine really flies. Boots quickly and  apps come up instantly.It also was delivered a day early. I'm impressed!I am very pleased with this machine.", b'Purchased this refurbished HP EliteBook 8460P as a work computer. I wanted something around $200 that would be used for grading, writing, teaching, and various other boring events.In the two weeks I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a couple glitches, but, even if those glitches weren\xe2\x80\x99t attended to (continue to read) this computer would be exactly what I wanted. I was originally nervous about \xe2\x80\x9crefurbished\xe2\x80\x9d but Amazon, Blazing Prices, and the one year warranty, gave me assurance that if anything was amiss, I could get help.Two items were a little off and were rectified quickly by Blazing Prices. The original battery wasn\xe2\x80\x99t holding a 100% charge and Blazing Prices refunded me the amount it cost for me to replace the battery (I had my money from Blazing Prices 4.5 hours after explaining the situation, WOW!). The second was more of a communication issue: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize I had to enter the Windows 10 key to activate Windows 10. That also was rectified (it\xe2\x80\x99s on a sticker on th bottom of computer and the buyer has to scratch off the first 5 numbers like a lottery ticket).I will purchase this product again (probably for family at Christmas)', b"I purchased two of these last fall and have been very impressed by their performance and build quality. I upgraded the hard drives that came with them to 256 gb SSD ones and also upgraded the ram to 16 gb.  They boot up in about 12 seconds and run everything I have used with them very nicely.  The design and build quality is considerably better than what you get in a consumer class laptop. The all metal case oozes quality and getting access to the inside from the bottom to do upgrades and such doesn't even require a screw driver.The examples I received were cosmetically perfect, with no scratches, dents or screen imperfections.", b"The computer is fast and no issues. I received clear instructions on how to activate windows despite other reviews saying it was difficult. You simply pull out the battery and scratch off (similar to a gift card of scratch-off lottery ticket) the registration key. The only bad thing about this laptop is it is massive. It looks like a retro 90's laptop with how thick it is. If you are looking for something sleek and lightweight, this isn't for you. However if you aren't concerned over appearances, this is a great laptop.", b"I received my laptop and as I booted it up, it told me I was missing my operator system. I got ahold of the seller and they sent me a new harddrive and I youtubed a video on how to install it (very simple) and everything was fine. I love this laptop. The battery isn't very good but that's ok, I just keep it plugged in. Very affordable for what I needed. Browse the internet, watch livestreams, etc. It's a great refurb and you can't beat the price!", b"Got the EliteBook 8460P today and it was like NEW, cosmetically and functionally.  Great deal for a Core i5 processor with 8GB RAM.  It is plenty fast with Windows 10 Pro for most applications.  I don't use it for games, but for everything else, personal or business use, it's a steal.  I am very happy with it.  The fingerprint reader works with Windows 10 Pro if you load the software application from HP--the driver is already loaded.  I am VERY satisfied with my purchase.This merchant (Lap-Top of the Line) does sell on eBay as well for less, but I have been assured that those laptops are NOT in the pristine condition or as well equipped (i.e., 8 GB vs 4 GB RAM) as the ones on Amazon.  For me, it was worth the price difference.", b'Just received it today. Everything works 100%.  Some small observations. Ram supplied was only 4gb instead of 8gb as stated by the seller.  Small vertical white line on screen monitor probably due to hardware issue.  Will try to test on external monitor to confirm.  Otherwise, just have to cough up some $ to increase memory to 8gb. Not worth complaining since I got free shipping from Amazon plus 1 year warranty (I hope). My son is using it for Autocad and is pleased with the speed and price. I am wishing it lasts a full year and then I will be really pleased with this purchase.  Other than a small (10cm) dent on the top cover and only 4gb install, still a really good buy.']}

wrote my review about the Tree New Bee Cooling Pad, giving it 5 stars.  A few days later, the front two fans stopped working.  The other problem I began having was one of the front toggles that help hold your computer in place keeps breaking off.  It's easy enough to fix, but it's annoying and keeps happening.So I contacted Tree New Bee to ask what to do about my defective pad.  I had missed the return window at Amazon by about a week.  Tree New Bee didn't answer.  They were quick enough to contact me and ask me for a good review, even offering me a 2-year extended warranty for writing a good review.  I did and so I assume that I am covered by their promised 2-year extended warranty, but without the company contacting me back, my warranty is useless.  So I have had to re-think my original review.  When the pad was working, it was great.  Once I had problems, the lack of support from Tree New Bee made the cooling pad basically worthless.  A product can only be as good as the people who stand behind it, and that is NOT Tree New Bee.I would stay far away from this one, because if you buy it, you'll be standing alone and taking your chances.  Personally, I plan to never buy ANYTHING sold by Tree New Bee.  I'm guessing all the good reviews about Tree New Bee and their products are because people haven't had a problem and therefore haven't had to deal with the company.", b"Day 1 review - I really am happy I purchased this cooling pad.  I'm a software developer and I'm pretty hard on my laptop - it's an I7 from System-76 and it normally runs hot.  I run netdata to monitor services and am including a screenie that makes it pretty obvious at what point I put the laptop onto the cooling pad.  So, yeah - 5-stars.  Over a reasonable period of time, I'll make edits if necessary.", b'This is a very good product. I use it daily with my Alienware laptop.PROS:1. Frame is solid and the mesh that lets air through is made of sturdy metal. I assume it\'s aluminum because the entire unit is very light weight.2. You can use the cooling pad flat, or tilted up at an angle by extending two retractable legs in the back. It provides very good cooling in both the flat and tilted mode.3. There are 4 fans which are variable speed with two separate speed controllers. One controls the two left fans and the other controls the two right fans.4. VERY quiet. I use both pairs of fans at full power and this unit is exceptionally quiet. If it wasn\'t for the blue light glow I wouldn\'t know they were on, especially if you have a TV or radio playing in the background, or any sound coming from your PC (music, videos, etc.)5. It\'s stylish. Not just a rectangular slab. The design has interesting angles and the fans have a blue LED light glow when they are turned on.CONS:The only reason that this review got only 4 stars is because of the con listed below.1. My laptop weights about 8.5 pounds.When the cooling bad is tilted the laptop (due to the weight and smooth surfaces) tends to slide downward and would slide off the pad. FORTUNATELY, the pad has two flip up "pins" that act to stop a laptop from sliding off (great idea). The problem is that because of the weight of my laptop those "pins" will often pop off of the unit. I have been able to pop them back in, but it is annoying to do so. It also makes me worried that if this happens when the laptop is unattended, the laptop could slide off and hit the floor. Therefore, when I leave the laptop I tilt the cooling pad down so it is in lying flat.So, my only warning to any purchaser is that if you have a heavy laptop,be aware of this so that you don\'t end up damaging your computer. (By the way, I\'ve been thinking of crazy gluing the pins in the open position to keep them from popping off. Of course that would leave two pegs sticking up when I\'m trying to store it in my computer bag.)OVERALL:A very good product that will adequately cool your laptop. I recommend this product with a 4-star rating.', b'Seems like these days, if you don\'t give 5 stars, it must mean it\'s crap. Please understand that\'s not the case with this review.Things I love: The price is competitive and I love how it actually fits my 17" laptop (Asus GL702VM) where many of them others feel too small.  I like how high it lifts the rear of the laptop for an angled typing experience and how you can turn off some fans as necessary. Using a wall-plug watts draw meter to my laptop while hooked up to this cooler, with all fans running at full speed, it draws just shy of 5 extra watts over my laptops regular idle draw - Worth it for the additional cooling it provides to my inherently hot running gaming laptop. It lowers my load temps by almost 5c. Braided cord is a nice touch and having the USB pass-through integrated in to the rear is better than ones that included as part of the cable head, have them sticking out the side of your USB port.Things I don\'t like: The cooler has no venting on the side so if you have it flat on your lap, you\'re choking the fans of air and effectively killing the cooler\'s ability to cool your laptop.  You can\'t raise the rear either because they\'re of a individual peg design which causes them to dig in to your thighs vs a smooth bar extending across the entire thing (as others have designed). Because of that, it also makes it unstable for any surface but a flat hard surface like a table. Also the pegs on the front of the cooler that pop up to keep your laptop from sliding down, ugh... terrible. It\'s sharp plastic and digs in to your forearm. Check out the picture I\'ve added of the marks it leaves on my forearm in just the tiny amount of time it took me to write this review.  At least add some creature comforting and make them rounded solid pegs, perhaps rubber capped or something. Come on! The only thing I can think of is to dremel them down flush to my laptop size so they stop digging in but I don\'t want to give an excuse to void my warranty.In conclusion this cooler has a lot of things going for it but just needs some refinement and it would sweep the floor. It still provides one of the better values among the laptop coolers and is a solid 4 stars. Would be 5 stars if it could address the issues I brought up.  However I have to knock one more star off because they are too aggressive in spamming you to review their product. When I purchase items of Amazon, I usually do get an email asking for a review, maybe 2nd one, I\'ll tolerate, but 6 emails guys (and who knows, maybe more if I had waited longer)? See attached picture of said emails. One email is sufficient as to not nag your customers. Overall I recommend this cooler if you can live with the issues I mentioned.']}

(I prefer this design better)- Red Backlit keyboard (Color cant be changed, but I wasnt specifically looking for a flashy laptop so this is just a plus)- Overall Matte Black texture around the laptop with pleasing MSI dragon logo on the back screen.- AntiGlare Screen- Num. Pad keyboard- Comes with 1 year manufacturer warranty(US) (You'll have to activate it online yourself.)Cons:- Although aesthetically pleasing, the Matte Black Plastic Finish is a FINGERPRINT/OIL magnet and takes more than just a dry cloth to remove- 8GB RAM (I intend to add on another 8GB stick in the nearby future)- Battery life is ridiculous when playing games- Fans are REALLY loud when playing games (Not much of a problem if you wear headphones, and is expected as it does a splendid job keeping the laptop cool)- Speakers are subpar (Again, not much of a problem if you wear headphones)Overall, I was in the market specifically for a laptop that had a good CPU/GPU, and both an SSD and HDD. I stumbled upon many competitor laptops along the same price range however, some were missing an SSD or HDD, or had the regular 1050 GPU which comes with only half (2GB) of dedicated memory of what the Ti model has (4GB). If I had purchased those laptops instead, and added on a separate SSD OR HDD, the total cost spent would be above $1000. The laptop is surprisingly light for a gaming laptop, and comes in a sleek yet aggressive theme, which wasn't what I was in the market for but is a plus to me. Most people who game on laptops would know that you get better frames while plugged in to the charger (This is due to bottlenecking of either the CPU or GPU demanding more power, yet the battery cannot provide that power alone), so the low gaming battery life is not much of a problem considering you should be plugged in to get the best performance, and the battery life outside of gaming is average (4-6 hours) depending on what work you'll be doing. Ultimately, the laptop met more than my needs and was in my price range ($899, $960~ after taxes), and I expect to be using it throughout and well after the years of college.", b"Fast, keyboard feels wonderful, as a basic gaming machine it does what I need at a price I can tack.  I use it mainly to run multiple photo editting software, photoshop, ACDsee, some canon software and i like to run all at the same time.  The processing power and graphic card is making that a breeze.  I specialize in making pano's and merged photos for proper exposure and wanted a laptop that could do it without getting bogged down.  This has it.  Really fast, i can put together 15 raw photos (30mb size each) and while it's processing the photos still be processing batches of basic edits on my other software while I'm surfing the web and do it all with no glitches and it's fast.  The flat, non glossy screen is doing a great job and showing me the correct colors also.  Used the laptop to edit one set and then transferred my drive to my main calibrated monitor and was very pleased how accurate the match was.  Excellent for a laptop monitor.  I'll be satisfied to use the screen for such in a pinch to do quick edits and not worry I've made something nuclear or drab.", b'Great laptop. I played overwatch a lot on console and wanted to switch to pc. I was worried about frame rate drops and ugly graphics. But im running overwatch on Ultra settings and frames never dropping below 70 runs smooth as silk. Very happy!', b"Bought this PC a little less than 3 months ago after my Acer laptop of 8-9 years started deteriorating too much. Was waiting to post a review til I've used it a bit.It's been good on most fronts -- runs games pretty fast, and everything has mostly been running quickly. Some downsides are the fans get quite loud sometimes (but when wearing headphones, you won't notice it as much) and the whole PC also tends to get very hot, including the keys.After these little less than 3 months, I've now encountered a random issue of one of the keys -- the 'o' key -- not working well at all. It has to be forcefully pushed down for it to register, and sometimes doesn't work unless I've pushed it really hard several times over. I have no idea why it's been doing this; I've been very careful with the computer and have never spilled anything or got anything stuck in the keys. I'm going to have it checked out soon, but with seeing more reviews on here also noting keyboard issues and other online reviews saying the same, I'm thinking it may be a more common MSI issue, which is rather upsetting. I hope I can get it settled soon, because it's otherwise been a nice computer.Edit: Also, I noticed someone on here noted that you have to buy a license to use the webcam, but that is not true. All you need to do is remove the app that is installed for the specialty webcam that you have to pay for, and use the regular webcam that does not require you to pay anything and works like a normal webcam should. That had an easy solution.", b"Honestly this laptop does me wonders. I play all of my games very smoothly and I only got this laptop for $900. The keyboard feels great, the backlit keyboard is awesome. Fast start up with windows being on the SSD while I could install my games on the hybrid disc. Honestly, if you're looking to buy a laptop well under $1000, this is a pretty good choice. If you want to upgrade to 16GB of RAM, you could do it easy."]}

For starters the description stated that it had a LED back light, and it didn't. When I first opened the laptop and plugged it up of course there was things that needed to be installed and updated. This took about 2 hours. I mean i have others computers and tablets in my home on the same Wi-Fi connection and all move fast but not this device. After everything was installed and updated, when opening the web browser that even loads slow. I purchased this laptop for school and also because I felt like it was a great price but I would rather spend an additional $200.00 on another laptop and know that I wouldn't have to worry about speed and an update every time I open my laptop. Battery life sucks too on this device. I mean I wouldn't even give my 8 yr old daughter this laptop. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY SAVE AND GET SOMETHING ELSE!", b"This computer is so slow it is not possible to actually use it.  I don't know if it's defective or if this is just a really poor design, but either way, it's going back and I would not recommend buying it.", b'Very inexpensive laptop with lots of features.  However, the CUP and 4GB of RAM is woefully inadequate to run Windows10. It bogs down with the installed Microsoft Edge browser and is slightly better with Chrome.  Installation of any antivirus program further slows it down. Not recommended.  Spend the extra money on an upgraded laptop.', b"This computer is super slow, which I guess wouldn't be so bad if the battery life lasted. I bought this computer 6 months ago because my other Lenovo was having to stay plugged in to use. Time for an upgrade! Well we don't use a computer at home often, just here and there for homework, projects or crafts. So in the last 6 months we've used it a handful of times, using it for the last 20 minutes it has already dropped 20% in battery life. 1% per minute!!! What a joke! Such a waste of money because we basically need to use it as a desktop, so that it can stay plugged in. Which is where our other computer is, after being 6 years old.", b'Bought this for wife. She loves it. Awesome laptop for money.', b'My 4 year old Lenovo laptop, which sounds like it is going to explode and likes to randomly shut itself off, is considerably faster than this laptop. Still trying to fix this issue while resisting the urge to throw it against a wall. Too lazy to return. At least it was cheap and is pretty purple.', b"I have had this computer for about a month now, it's great. It is a little slow as some other reviews have pointed out but it really isn't an issue. I play Stardew Valley on it with no problem and you absolutely cannot beat the storage for the price. It is sleek and light, and I am so grateful to have a laptop.", b'This is my SECOND IdeaPad since Dec. the first had broken keys and now this one, the day after I was elidgible for refund the screen broke.

Through intelligent algorithms, it optimizes the sharpness and contrast of every pixel in every frame by up to 150% to produce incredibly vivid and realistic imagery no matter the source.', b'As a straight purchase, upgrade to the SSD version as the HD version performs poorly with a lot of lag just the Win10 environment.  Lag was down right annoying in applications.The Bad:I had purchased this based on the empty m.2 SSD slot for an extra drive; however, the m.2 slot is not supported with the BIOS that ASUS has loaded on the MB.  When I contact ASUS, I got mixed results.  But when it was clear to them I was wanting to use the m.2 slot, it became all \'please use a professional certified upgrader\', etc.  Further help was cut off.  This is why I\'m docking 2-stars.Based on tips online and some off-the-script guidance from ASUS, I tried reinstalling Win10 on the HD with no noticable improvment. Ultimately ended up installing a 2.5" SSD and reinstalling Win10 as it was past the return period and all the troubleshooting I had done pretty much blocked a return anyways.The Good:Empty memory slot makes it easy to double RAM to 16GB. And I had no issues with RAM upgrade.ASUS support was good on helping with a track pad issue (BIOS update) and which 2.5" SSD\'s could be installed.With the new 2.5" SSD and Win10 freshly installed, this is a great laptop.  Lag begone!  No lag issues in O365, and I am even running Lightroom without issues.  Battery life is good.  Web-browsing and O365 apps seem to get 4-6 hours per charge.  LR burned through a charge in <2 hours, but it\'s LR, right?  No issues with heat build up.  Unit runs cool, even in LR.  I am going to try loading up a few games to see how they run.This unit is not bulky due to the thin bezel around the screen.  It feels more like a 14" computer, but the screen view is \'huge\'.  The graphics look  nice for a laptop and definitely top-notch in this price range.  The case feels a little flimsy.  Opening things up, it is clear there is not much stiffening material in the case/shell.  But I am not hard on my electronics (I don\'t expect them to survive a two-story drop unharmed).  I do not expect to have issues beyond normal wear.  The weight is light enought that I would compare it to the Mac Airbook it is replacing (yes, I went Apple for a bit, but I\'m back folks!).  The small charger unit is a bonus too.  This will not take up much room in any bag.Final Word:OK, master plan to get a powerhouse laptop for less than $1000 was not totally realized.  But with the SSD and a stick of memory, this is a great iCore7 laptop for the money.  Advice to potential buyers: go ahead and get the SSD version.', b'Surprisingly well optioned for the price. Light weight. Very fast. Shipping was quick and packaging was adequate to protect during shipping. Only draw back is that the power button is located right next to the delete button. It is annoying when typing and you accidentally hit the power button. Other than that little complaint, LOVE working on this machine.', b'Nice computer, however, no backlight for keyboard, or num lock/ caps lock indicator.', b"*LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS!! THIS IS A BUDGET LAPTOP, NOT A GAMING LAPTOP*Read this ^^ , Read it again..Now that you've seen this disclaimer let me just say this.. I was in the very same position you are in right now but only a few days ago. Coming from an Intel Core i3 DESKTOP, this laptop has proven to be everything and anything I would want for a laptop at this price point. This laptop comes with an Intel Core i7 CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce 940MX GPU. A full 1920 x 1080 HD screen, if you are coming from excellence this laptop is good. If you come from trash this laptop will be the world to you. That being said, there are some cons as with any piece of technology. This laptop suffers from Slow Start.. and no I do not mean the Pokemon ability :D . This computer seems to have an issue downloading and installing the newest version of Windows 10 during startup. After all the updates on this laptop is made, it is great, fast and beautiful. It's almost MacBook-ish in it's sleek design (it has better speakers though :) ). At the end of the day I can only do so much, the choice is ultimately yours to make. That being, I DOUBT you can find another laptop at this price point that is better than this.", b'This laptop is was so cool. I was able to multi task while working online as an ESL teacher. I can run a lot of application and it responded really fast. It can also get the highest internet connection from the broadband. It is really lightweight and the sound it was loud, louder than my old hp notebook.It was more than what I was expecting for. It even has an automatic installment of windows and there was like a bot that recognizes my voice the first to help me with the installation of the windows. I thought its gonna be hard to use the windows 10 but I was mistaken. It can also sustain a gameplay especially in LoL.One thing that disappointed me was the longetivity of the battery which was stated like "8h battery life (full working day)" but the charge is only lasting for 4hrs. NOTE: The battery is not detachable.By the way, I appreciated amazon in giving back the express fee I spent for this, since it had a delay in the delivery.', b'Love it, price worth this device, recommend update hard disk to SSD, performance is good, even under heavy load laptop not make load noise.', b'This laptop exceeded my expectations. It is very light weight. I have carried it in my camera bag and did not even realize it was there. It is very fast. I can do Lightroom and Photoshop editing on it with ease. The 1 TB hard drive is plenty roomy. I have all 12,000 of my digital photos on it with plenty of room to spare. I only wish it had an SSD, but I can always add one later.I probably use this laptop 10-12 hours a day, every day and I have not had the first problem with it.', b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe other customers complaning about windows taking forever to update; it took over 10 hours (I went to sleep, so it could be more time) to complete the update, recommendation downlod the iso file from microsoft instead.Overall a lightweight  and great laptop; second recommendation upgrade to SSD, I also bought the crucial micron m..500; super easy to install and the improvement is noticeable from start.No ethernet port, if you are planning on using it with Wi-fi only is ok, you can get an usb (2.0 or 3.0) to ethernet adapter if needed.']}

Since the seller doesn\'t list the model number, I looked up the specs and assumed they were selling the 320.  This is actually the Ideapad 110.  From 2016.  Still works as a computer, but nothing gets me madder than false advertising to lure unsuspecting people, like me, into sales.', b"I bought this laptop to replace an almost 10 year old laptop (it was high end when bought) that really couldn't hold up to the advances in technology. I was looking to buy one of the cheapest brand new laptops possible to replace the old one since this laptop is just for my kids. This computer works so much better than the old one. My kids are finally able to do their school work and play their school games on this new laptop and it doesn't freeze up or have problems loading things. Can't complain when you get an entire computer for $250. When I built a computer not too long ago, it was almost $100 for Windows alone. So if you're looking for a cheap laptop that will do the basics, including a dvd drive, this one will work for you.", b'I am not speaking on behalf of the entire line of this product but on the particular laptop i received. Please keep in mind that other people may have received this model laptop and have had a different experience.Pros:Good Processor (Eats all daily tasks and asks for more)Good Integrated Graphics (Plays non tripple A titles with ease. League/Dota2 with ease)Temperatures remain in check for daily use.Cons:-Poor build Quality (Keyboard came with 2 physical keys outputting incorrect characters)-Battery is located on the outside but not removable unless unscrewed from the inside. Battery has internal connection.-The keyboard is not separate from the face of the laptop, not easily replaced.In Between:not exactly upgrade friendly as there is no Separate RAM/HDD Covers however, the entire bottom of the laptop is removable which is easier than some other laptops where you have to remove the keyboard to get access to the motherboard.Reasoning on 2 starThe particular laptop i received had one major flaw which rendered it useless. Its "Shift Key" did not work. When pressed during a general typing session it would output various random keystrokes which can do anything from typing "fjoiwk" to Shutting down the Laptop. This has made the laptop unusable.', b"If you want to get so frustrated that you imagine punching a laptop with your fist or violently slamming a laptop into a million flying pieces onto the concrete outside, then buy this waste of money. All I wanted was a simple laptop to browse the internet and download and view PDF files. I can't get Windows 10 to update, file explorer to open, and the wheel just sits and spins with nothing opening. Start up is extremely, anciently slow and programs won't open, not even task manager. I'm not tech savvy and just don't have the time to try to trouble-shoot the problems. Now after trying for 4 hours to view a PDF document, I can't even get the search bar to allow me to type in it to try to open file explorer that way instead of using the desktop icon. I will never, ever buy another Lenovo again. Plus, I can't return it because I've owned it for 2 months. Here's the kicker, It's 10:45 pm and I needed to get some work done for a meeting tomorrow and I can't even view or print the documents I need. This laptop will zap your happiness and cost you time and money unless you're computer savvy.", b'I wish i had listened to the one star review saying the product that is being advertised and the one that is being sold is two different laptops!. The laptop I received is the lenovo idea pad 110. See for yourself below', b"This is a pretty decent budget laptop. It's not going to play a bunch of games, but it'll surf the net, it'll let you type out some documents, it's a handy device.I'm glad I bought it, it gets daily use in my home.", b"I've had this laptop for about 2 months now and I have to say it was worth what I paid for it.It's a $275 laptop so I didn't have high expectations on performance etcIt is rather slow if you load up multiple programs and tabs at the same time.  If you limit your multi-tasking to 2 or 3 programs, it runs rather smoothly.Gaming wise, I would not recommend it unless you are playing older games pre-2006.  I've tried running League of Legends on it, which is a popular game with rather low system requirements.  On low settings, I still had performance issues.There are only 2 usb drives which is annoying as most laptops have 3.  Also the slot where you plug in the power cord into the laptop is at an awkward location on the left side of the laptop.  The power plug also is designed very awkwardly, plugging it into a power strip, you'll notice that due to its size it'll take more space on it than a standard laptop power cord.Overall, if its a cheap laptop you're looking for.  This would come recommended.  If you're expecting longevity and performance, you will be slightly disappointing.", b"Had to return due to AT&T needing a digitally signed version of SPR Protocol Driver to provide Internet service. The software developer appears to be out of business so such couldn't be obtained. Thank goodness I realized the problem with 1 DAY LEFT FOR A FULL REFUND!! (:)"]}

Thanks so much.', b'Body is in great condition on the Macbook and its a fast computer! Great for price!!!', b'This is more than what I expected! Honestly, I thought it was going to be dirty, beat up and maybe not even work, especially for the price. But when I got it, it was absolutely perfect!', b"It's very impressive. I got more than expected new enough for OS X El Capitan but not new enough for OS X sierra. That's fine though.", b"Very impressed, it's fast, very fast. Lightening fast. I didn't know laptop could be so fast. I would recommend this to anyone. Looking for a laptop.", b'Purchased as a gift for a young girl. Perfect for a first computer.', b'Device arrived in good shape and as advertised.  Its older tech, but still perfect for young ones to use for school assignments.  I especially appreciated how many apps were already loaded on, saving many $$.  Overall, I am pleased.  This is worth the money especially if the budget is a little tight.  I would buy it again.', b'Great quality came early and got it working great.']}

No issues and works as good as any we have. I use these as register computers for my stores. So this gets used a lot everyday. Couldn't ask for better. Will order more as backups now.  My order came very fast and was packaged very well.", b'Ordered an E6430, received an E6430S. The pictures and description clearly stated and showed an E6430. the S model has less USB ports, less connectivity/upgrade options, and a mini vs regular HDMI port all in a different chassis than the E6430. Also, pictures showed a CDRW drive, both models originally come with a CDRW drive but mine simply has a cheap aftermarket piece of plastic covering where the drive should be.', b"I love my new laptop! I put a 240gig SSD I had laying around and installed Windows 10 Pro with my USB that has the 1709 Build on it. I activated my laptop and it is Blazing!!!! Kinda like the company :)For the record.....the Processor in this is only 9% slower than it's brother in the 7th Gen era. Don't spend $100's more because you think you are getting a better product. Also to note......The Intel 4000 Graphics run circles around the 500-600 Series Intel Graphics chips in a lot of bench marks.Also I must add, this laptop looks and feels 100% brand new!", b'I  believe these reviews are nit genuine. This computer did not work. Had to turn it on computer at least 5 times just to get it to start. Could not turn it on after that. Does not have windows installed at all. Computer is defective and not refurbished, I am returning the product and would advise everyone to not purchase any products from this seller. You will be disappointed.', b'I have bought this laptop from BLAZING PRICES. I had a battery issue with this computer. Its battery is draining very fast (it runs out around 10 minutes). In the product details, it says the laptop has a 1 year warranty but when I contacted Dell, they said this computer\'s warranty expired. When I contact Blazing Prices company, they said I should contact with Dell. That company is not helpful to its customers. And they lied to me by saying that the computer has a 1 year warranty. Don\'t buy anything from Blazing Prices. When you ask something about the product you bought to this company, they answer very late. Whenever you email them to ask something, they say " your inquiry will be given high priority", but they don\'t do that. This company is not honest to their customers.In terms of the refurbished laptops, make sure the battery is working well. Other than the batter, the laptop is okay.', b'I decided to wait until I had this laptop computer for sufficient amount of time to adequately evaluate all of the good and bad. After 2+ months of owning this Dell laptop, I am still waiting to find a single good point to this computer.Since day 1, it has run incredibly slow and that has only gotten worse. The battery life is far less than advertised. This laptop has a maximum battery for about 2.5 hours, which is less than advertised. The graphics are weak and washed out and definitely does not have the promised degree of resolution. I understand this was a refurbished computer but this product is terrible. If the option to rate this lower than 1 star, that is what this product deserves.I cannot emphasize this point enough -- DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER, EVER!!!!No matter how low the price, you will you be disappointed by this computer.', b"I was nervous to purchase a laptop online, especially a used one. I bought my laptop from HawkDeals (Joy Systems). I was looking for a laptop to primarily be used with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse I already had. The laptop arrived within a few days and was as described. It does make a loud noise when the lid isn't closed properly, but other than that I had no issues activating Windows 10. I was able to purchase a used Dell Port for $40 from amazon and bought Microsoft Office 2016 Download and License for $89 from an online store.  It was defiantly cheaper than purchasing a brand new laptop and I still am able to use the latest software.The only con would be that the Dell Latitude E6430 does not have a number pad on the right side of the keyboard. Since I am hooking it to an external keyboard it was not a big deal for me.If I have to purchase another used laptop, I would get it from HawkDeals again.", b"I've had this for several weeks now, and quite simply this is how I plan on ordering my laptops from here on out. First and foremost, it looked like day 1 brand new, never seen a day of work in its life prior to me powering it on. Now, the reason I selected this particular laptop setup as I had the same model at work before a company mandated upgrade. This system at the cost blows away brand new, cost driven laptops by leaps and bounds. For my money, and yours, getting this with a I5-3320M cored intel processor, 8 gb of RAM, and windows 10 PRO 64 bit kicks the digital crap out of the new, 200 systems with the lightweight, fluffy processors and such. I am also a fan of this order style power adapter, my previous personal Dell power supply works and is robust. The new generation laptop power adapters with the tiny barrel seem like crap to me and are very fragile. Long live the E6430 laptop"]}

I followed the instructions exactly as to fully charging the battery pack and allowing it to discharge down to 7% for the first 3 times before actually using the computer.  I think this stuff is very important as the battery would discharge quickly down to 7% which had me worried about the battery life. However, after performing 3 consecutive discharges to 7%, the battery life is a little over 4 hours which I am very pleased with!!!', b'Arrived early and was 91% charged.  Snapped perfectly into my 1545.  Followed the instructions about cycling from full charge before use and then recharging when discharged down to 7%.  Works like a champ.', b'only had it a few days but was fully charged ready to go and with the new cord I also bought with plug into computer that fit and stayed tight has put new life into my old computer. Very pleased and a great value.', b"It fit my old Dell laptop and has been working great. I honestly didn't expect it to work as well as it has been.", b'Since this is a battery, it will take at least one charge cycle before I can provide an actual review on product quality. This review will be updated once I have had time to truly test the product.That being said....Pros:Delivered on time and in good condition.Nice / fair price point for this product.Contained instructions / first charge cycle / usage card that (and this is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT) is legible with large print, grammatically  correct and in English. I have purchased WAY too many electronics I could not read the instructions (even with magnification) and those that I could magnify where in broken English and not easily followed.Cons:If there are any, I will modify this review.', b"So far so good. Replaced the factory battery in a Dell laptop with this one and the computer recognized it without any problems at all. I'm getting anywhere from 2.5 to 3 hours or so of life out of this batter on a full charge and that is about what I would expect. Of course that is with continuous use. It sure beats the heck out of spending 4 or 5 times as much for a direct factory replacement. Quality is top notch. It seems just as well built as the factory original. I can't tell the difference. So far so good.", b"Working good so far on old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1545. I'm also using a new Dell PA-21 65Watt Adapter for it, which is same as old stock Adapter. The new battery didn't recognize the old adapter so I was lucky enough to find same one on Amazon \xf0\x9f\x98\x80", b'Purchased for a several year old Dell Inspiron. The computer is seldom used but battery life never was very good. To be fair it may not have been "seasoned" properly, but in last year or two, life was down to about 10 minutes. The new battery has restored life to two and a half hours or more. Needless to say, quite happy with it.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive.

The new ZenBook UX330UA packs latest 8th gen Intel Core i5 processor and a responsive 256GB Solid State Drive (SSD), everything from startup to loading demanding programs happens in a flash. Its previous generation UX330-AH54 received lots of positive reviews from media on its outstanding performance, long battery life at affordable price that outshines many other laptops. Our new UX330-AH55 can only possibly do better.', b"Exceptional laptop. With that 8th gen Core i5, it's such a pleasure to use this for anything (heck, I was playing a freaking 8K video and a 4K video at the same time and it still wouldn't drop frames), all while battery life is absolutely great. The chassis is sturdy yet very light weight. Really not much to complain about. If you want a lightweight, premium, top performance ultrabook, this is the one to get.My only gripe was that the display seemed to have a bit of green tint, very noticeable when compared to my phone's calibrated display or the Samsung Chromebook Pro I tried for a while, but lowering the Green contrast to 46 from 50 in Intel Graphics settings solved it. I also bumped the saturation just +5, and the screen looks gorgeous now\xe2\x80\x93very similar to my small Pixel 2 which is very well calibrated. Only tip is to uninstall ASUS Splendid Video Enhancement Utility as it doesn't allow Intel Graphics Settings to stay after sleep or reboot for some reason, probably because both have calibration options and conflict with each other.With the display fixed, this thing is 10/10. Fan noise is actually very low or non existent in most tasks. Only when I put it under heavy load (like syncing 12,000 files on Google Backup & Sync) do you hear it and even then it's not annoying. And the touchpad does accidentally trigger 'double tap and drag' when you don't want to a few times, but honestly I usually disable 'double tap to drag' because I rarely drag and when I do, it's more natural to click and drag instead of double tapping.This is a great buy that will last you for a long time given the sturdy chassis and future-proof specs.", b"Are you on a mid to high end budget? Trying to find a PC that's lightweight and small, without compromising power? Do you care little for 2-1 computers or touch screens? Then this laptop is for you.The specs on this little book are phenomenal. The main selling point for this computer is its 8th Gen Intel i5-8250U processor. The processor is monstrous for this price range. Its base speed of 1.6 GHz, means that your computer will be drawing as little power as possible for low demand tasks like word processing or internet browsing. But its turbo boost up to 3.4 GHz ensures that this laptop has power for more demanding tasks.Oh, and did I mention that this processor has FOUR CORES? Yes, that's right FOUR CORES. This is unusual at this price range, as many laptops on the market around $750 tend to have dual core processors instead. This laptop's processing power rivals, and some cases exceeds others around the $1,000 mark.The PC has enough RAM at 8 GB. Sufficient for most tasks the average consumer will face, and still enough for those looking for an edge. The 256 Solid State Drive provides a reasonable amount of storage. When combined with the processor on this PC, it boots up swiftly.Its battery is more than sufficient for all day use. If you find yourself running low on power, the charger itself is extremely lightweight, and in my experience the laptop is capable of charging around 50% of its battery to near full in about an hour.All of this performance doesn't even take into consideration that this laptop is a lightweight, coming in at 2.6 pounds. As a personal opinion, being able to pick up such a light computer knowing it packs FOUR CORES of power at this price range is an unparalleled high.This laptop is absolutely stellar.", b"OK I love it. Have had it for three weeks. Lightening fast. 8th gen i5 and 256 SSD. I love the keyboard . Don't understand the complaint that the feel is too light. No problem with shutdown/restart that some people have reported. Still learning Windows 10, up from Windows 7 on old p.c. Would have liked a third USB port since I use a mouse (old school). Speaking of old school, I don't have a screen bleed problem with gaming or watching videos because, well, I don't do that. No ghosting. No buttons popping off keyboard. I have not yet accidentally turned it off because of the location of the power button where the delete button usually is. I am satisfied with the battery life though it is not 12 hours. But I bet I could get there if I spent some time checking what apps run at startup. recharges fast. It's quiet. It is not hot. So far, I have not had any of the problems recorded by the folks who scored this a 1. So take the chance. It's a really fast, very light, easy to use Zenbook if you simply want a good computer.Model: ASUS ZenBook Ultra-Slim Laptop, 13.3-inch Full HD, 8th gen Intel i5-8250U Processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Backlit keyboard, Fingerprint Reader, Anti-Glare, Windows 10, Grey, UX330UA-AH55", b"I've only had this a week, but it's been a great week. I've used this laptop for writing reports, email, web browsing, minor photo editing, and wordpress development. It's worked perfectly for all of those tasks, with no slowdown that I've noticed at any time. Battery life is excellent, with around 10 hours of actual use, and very good standby battery life.The only issues I've had are 1) keyboard - the keys are just a bit . . . different. Sometimes I think that I hit a key, but it doesn't register. This mostly happens when I'm typing longer emails or I'm not paying as much attention. If I focus on my typing, it's not an issue. 2) Fan - the CPU fan comes on even during low intensity tasks like web browsing. It's not very loud, but it is noticeable. I wish it were quieter, but it's really not a big deal. For how smooth everything runs, I gladly take the fan noise. And 3) the left USB port doesn't work with my wireless mouse. The right USB port works, and the left USB port works with everything else I've tried, including a USB hub and a thumb drive. Not sure what the issue is there, but I just use the right port.I would definitely buy it again, and I think it's a great device for the price."]}

{'asin': 'B06X1869F3', 'title': 'Amazon.com: HP - 17.3" Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 1TB HDD: Computers & Accessories', 'price': '', 'date': '                        February 13, 2017\n                        ', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b'After a couple of years of extremely heavy use, my Toshiba Satellite was getting a little testy.  Keys were starting to stick, there was a flaw in the display, and the power jack was loose, which meant that half the time I couldn\'t get it to charge.  To replace or reset the power jack, I\'d have had to remove the battery, keyboard, hard drive, and CD drive, as well as disconnect the keyboard, touchpad, etc.  Sooooo many ways that could go wrong.  So even though it wasn\'t really in the budget, I started shopping for a new laptop.My requirements were at least 6GB RAM, a 17" monitor, Windows 10, at least 750GB hard drive, and less than $500...preferably less than $400.  I found what I thought was a good replacement directly on HP\'s website, but after checking with someone a bit more knowledgeable about processors, I was directed to this one instead.  The i5 dual core, as it turns out, is a hell of a lot more powerful than the AMD A-8 quad core. With the Memorial Day sale I caught, this laptop with more memory, more RAM, and a better processor cost less than what I spent on my Satellite a couple of years ago, so I went for it.Now, I should warn anyone who\'s used to a smaller laptop that this one is pretty heavy.  However, that\'s impossible to avoid when buying a computer this size on a budget.  Also, if you haven\'t used Win10 before, it will take a little getting used to, but it\'s nowhere near the nightmare that Win8 was.  Fortunately, I\'ve been using Win10 since they first allowed me to upgrade, so I\'m more than used to it by now. As for what HP has done with this laptop...CONS:  (1) Speakers are on the bottom of the unit, which is about the dumbest design I\'ve ever seen.  Good luck hearing decent sound if you have your LAPtop on your actual lap.  (2) It\'s got 3 USB ports but no obvious way to tell which one is the 3.0. I\'m guessing it\'s the one in the right.  (3) The power button has no light indicator. so you hit the button and it looks like nothing\'s happening until a few seconds later when the monitor finally flashes on.  You have to look over on the side next to the power jack to see a tiny white light that indicates power is on.  (4)  The\'s zero indication when num lock is on.  On my old computer, that key had a little light on it, so I could see what state it was in.  Apparently HP thinks you should have to try typing something to figure it out, and that\'s quickly getting on my nerves.PROS:  (1) Great monitor size and clarity for graphics, which is the whole reason I went with the 17".  Nice, bright display, too.  (2) Speedy processor compared to others in this range.  My heavier programs are moving much more quickly than on my old computer, and I\'m not missing those freezes at all!  (3) Plenty of memory for a ton of files and programs.  Generally not a good idea to fill it up, so I use an external hard drive for files I don\'t ned constant access to, but it\'s nice to know the space is there if I need it.  (4) Decent size touch pad makes for easy mouse movement.  I\'ve had several computers with a much smaller one, and they were kind of a pain.  (5) Incredible price for this much power/memory/functionality.  Could it be better?  Sure, but that would head into much higher cost territory.BOTTOM LINE:  If you\'re looking for some speed and a big display, but you\'re on a budget, this one\'s a fantastic buy.  If you\'re looking for something to handle some serious gaming, you\'re going to have to go a lot more expensive.', b"I've had my laptop for a few weeks now and LOVE it! Setup was easy and issue free. I was previously using an older model HP that was running Vista Business...so as you can imagine Windows 10 is a huge change for me, but this system has made it easy for me to make the switch. Although I love all the updated programs on this laptop, I was very happy that I was able to load my old Works 9 program on this system (I've kept a journal using this program since I was in junior high and didn't want to lose it). I was apprehensive about buying a laptop online and having it shipped, but I've had absolutely no issues and am extremely happy with this purchase.", b'Excellent laptop. Large screen, light weight, easy to connect to an external monitor, keyboard and mouse, if desired. Great for routine tasks and web browsing which is what we wanted.  Not designed for high end gaming, which we did not need.', b"look and feel 4/517 inch display 5/51 tb hard drive 5/58 gigs ddr4 memory 5/5 (more than enough for basic use)keyboard 5/5hdmi/usb ports 5/5 (good and tight fit when plugging in usb devices)dvd drive 3/5 (feels flimsy when pushing disk on spindle)touchpad 5/5processor speed 5/5graphics card/media playback 3/5 (local videos will sometimes block/distort)wifi  5/5 (only b,g or n but very good reception)bluetooth 4/5 (disconnects once in awhile,but not too often)windows 10 home 3.5/5overall its a very good basic laptop, if you do basic stuff ,you will like it.12-7-2017 updateinternet randomly stops working although it stays connected. windows diagnosis says dns error and default gateway error.i tried a few of the online fix suggestions but none worked. i'm not sure if this is a hardware fault or windows 10 fault. i used a ubuntu live cd to try and see if it did the same,but unfortunately the wifi hardware wasn't detected.so minus a star"]}

Often I find myself in my truck with the A/C on trying to fill out work orders, looking up parts, thumbing through a manual etc. I am driving a 2016 Ford Transit T150 and this fits very well. I am over 6 feet tall and 175 lbs so I am very slender and there is a sizeable 6-8 inch gap between me and the steering wheel desk so most guys will have "room to grow" so to speak.See my attached picture of how it fits with my laptop.Edit: Added photo with Crockpot lunch warmer to display how it sets up for lunch.', b"When this tray table arrived I was happy with the build quality. It's a good, solid piece of plastic - no flex at all - with one side more or less flat and the other with food and drink recessed sections, similar to an airplane tray table.I then went out to my car to test it but, try as I might, I couldn't get it to work. The hooks that hold it on to the steering wheel left so little room that it was obstructed by the surround that houses the buttons on the wheel (cruise control, volume up/down, etc.), forcing the tray to pitch up, which made it entirely unusable.Frustrated, I went inside and logged on to Amazon, ready to return a product that clearly only worked with steering wheels that don't have controls that get in the way of...Wait...hang on...GODDAMMIT!Yeah, I'm an idiot! You simply rotate your steering wheel 180 degrees, of course, and then it hooks on just fine to the now unobstructed wheel. Doh!So, great product. The problem was caused entirely by the thing between the steering wheel and the seat. ;)", b'Perfect fit for my patrol car. I use it with my keyboard to type reports and eat lunch off of.', b"Positive:sturdy. decent size, especially for note taking on notepad, (not regular size paper), good coverage for sloppy eaters (ha, like me), easily cleaned, easy to store in locker. Price ok (for a failed experiment)Negatives:If your steering wheel is padded at all, good chance it won't fit, making any positives moot (unless you just use it for a lap tray.) Cup indent is a bit small, so choose drinks wisely. diameter of steering wheel not an issue, just the thickness.I drive multiple vehicles with different size/shapes padded/not padded steering wheels, and it just barely fits on 1 of them, the small, unpadded one.I would love to reccomend the item, but make sure your steering wheel is on the thin side, preferably with little to no padding.", b"I needed something for my lap top as I'm on the road a lot with my construction company. I was worried that this might not work, however, its great for my needs. Now my neck is not bothering me after typing, it locks in easily under the steering wheel and its easy to store under the seat. Not much to say about it, very simple product, but a great solution for the price. I definitely recommend this product to anyone that will use a lap top in a car. Its big enough for most lap tops and its not flimsy. Works good", b'I bought this in Nov 2015. (Back then they offered the small one in black.)My husband uses it almost every day.  It\'s holding up extremely well, especially given how often it\'s used.  It gives him a little extra space in our small car to eat lunch on or rest his phone/tablet, and is small and light enough to be carried around in his back pack.  It cleans easily with warm water and dish soap.  His direct quote for this review is, "I wouldn\'t trust anything heavy that might spill easily (drinks, for example), but it stays up well, even with my tablet on it."I\'d purchase this again as well as recommend it to others.', b"It's a must if you are law enforcement. Wonder why my department didn't just add this to all of our units. Affordable and useful! Highly recommended.", b"... and the steering wheel doesn't have to be turned upside down.  This makes the occasional eating in the car much neater.  This table, I got the large one, is sturdy and does require a seat adjustment.  The flip side has a nice writing surface and a place to secure a pen or pencil.  Happy with my purchase."]}

RAM, Drive, software, everything is a fair game as you can make this compete with the higher end competitors.Cons and Oks:__________-  The screen froze two times on me after I watch a decent amount of online videos and use other smaller programs (PowerPoint, office, ect).  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is a glitch or if this computer can\xe2\x80\x99t handle multi-tasking.-  You can watch a movie on this but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to binge watch on Netflix this because, from my experience, the computer starts to run dead slow.-  2.16 Ghz, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t see it in this machine as sometimes the speed isn\xe2\x80\x99t there at all.  Keep in mind I\xe2\x80\x99m not using any other programs than internet browsing and video watching.-  The longer you use this computer you're going to see a decrease in loading time when your internet browsing.-  The keyboard isn\xe2\x80\x99t really comfortable and the plastic layout makes it feel extremely cheap. I understand for the price you\xe2\x80\x99re paying you should suspect lower in quality, but since most of the time, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be using the keyboard I only wish they put more effort in it.-  Want technical support; you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to pay for it.  You heard me correctly; you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay extra to get help if your computer isn\xe2\x80\x99t working.-  A lot of bloatware-  Wifi card isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best around as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d change in speed if you use an Ethernet cable.-  Sometimes the keyboard sensor under the letters will not work.-  Constant firmware updatesBottom Line:__________This is a family, a kid only, take to college kind of computer.  The simple tasks are all it\xe2\x80\x99s able to handle, and even then you still experience some errors.  Keep using it and you will see that webpages upload and download rate will make you use your smartphone instead.  But keep in mind it\xe2\x80\x99s the bare minimum for a laptop so the price is way below a touchscreen laptop.  If you\xe2\x80\x99re on a budget than \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe\xe2\x80\x9d you want to take a look on this.Overall, if you\xe2\x80\x99re planning to buy a laptop this is the cheapest you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get to have a touch screen built in.  Even with the price you\xe2\x80\x99ll still be facing a slow processor, cheap keyboard, and a weak Wi-Fi card.  Verdict: spend a $100 more to have a decent laptop as less than a year you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be hunting for another if you buy this.  But if you\xe2\x80\x99re surviving on pennies then this is going to be one of the cheapest layouts you\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to see.Hopefully I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer", b"Be careful when buying this laptop, processor is not 2.16ghz it's 1.60.  And the model is not N3540 it's N3710.", b"I love this laptop! I would recommend it to those looking for a laptop to do everyday tasks on. The touch screen is awesome! Never had a touchscreen laptop because I never really wanted one, but after getting this, I don't ever want to go without one! HP always amazes me.", b'I think i know why people say the computer is slower than what the processor said it is.The Box that the computer came in said the processor is a N3540 @ 2.16GHz . The computer actually has a N3710 @ 1.60GHz.  I will be giving HP a call', b"I've been looking for over a year for a laptop under 300.00 that has everything  I wanted. I had a burgundy hp picked out and on the day I was going to buy I saw this one and it was 40.00 cheaper. It had touchscreen a bigger drive and faster processor,  windows 10 ect. The other laptop didn't have any of these. Touchscreen sold me right there . This was easy to setup if you read the instructions ( guys ) shows you how to sync all of your devices so you can share videos, pics ect. You can take a pic with your phone and it will automatically  go to your laptop n save. Just love the ease and convenience.  I highly recommend  this laptop. I don't remember ever seeing a pc under 300.00 that's touchscreen.There's only one complaint I have... the battery life when not plugged in could be alot longer. I think that a battery should be able to last an entire flight. Sorry I'd give it a 5 star, but battery life is pretty important issue.", b'the battery life is at 100% is 3 hours and 14 minutes not the 6 hours that they tell you.', b'It works if you leave it plugged in.  battery would last about 3 hours.  Keyboard is really sensitive.  You get what you pay for.  We returned it because of the bad battery life.', b'Returned because track (mouse) was erratic and not following movement. CPU usage stayed at 100%  right out of the box']}

My little guy plays with it all the time. His 2 and a half year old brother also plays with it a some. I'm very happy with this toy. I haven't found anything about it yet that I don't like, and what's more important, neither has my grandson. Even after my 2 year old grandson spilt coke in it, it works perfectly. I simply cleaned it with a damp cloth, put paper towels in it and closed it, turning it upside down in order for any additional coke to drain out. We waited a couple of days and let it thoroughly dry out. Now it's as good as new. There are no problems with it after that accident, not even a stuck key. Awesome product. Well thought out and well built. I'm very happy with my purchase.", b'This is the sort of toy I have very mixed feelings about giving my kid.

Sexist much? Since both children have Dad's and a Grandpa in computer jobs they were excited about teaching the toddlers to play with them. We'll see what they have to say about how easy it is for the kids to learn and play with.", b"I'm a big fan of V-tech products so I was hoping this would be a great gift for my 2 year old, but this was very disappointing. The screen does not light up, it's very hard to use and not toddler friendly. (You have to literally push the button on the mouse for it to move subjects) No lights or interactive commentary to keep a toddler's interest. I would return it but we threw away the pkg that it came in so now we r stuck with this useless toy.I expected more from such a great brand like V-tech.", b'Always a great item!  We live in a small coastal tow with few choices to buy or access products. Amazon is our life saver and we can get exactly what we want or need.  Prices are always cheaper and the reviews tell us what users think or experience.  Thank you.']}

It is super soft on the inside and has very durable construction! I like that it has a shoulder strap that is also very comfortable. While this fits the 2012 version perfectly, beware that it is way too big for the newer macbook pro versions! Do not buy this just because it has the shoulder strap if you have the newer macbooks because your computer will be sliding all over the place! I will wait and see if Tomtoc comes out with a smaller version of this bag, because the bag really is awesome.', b'I was looking for a minimal size bag for my 15" MacBook Pro and this bag fits it like a glove! I like the two pockets for extra accessories. I like that the opening for the laptop is from a side.The only thing I would change is make the shoulder strap a bit shorter. Currently it is too long and because of that the slidable buckle prevents the shoulder pad from being in the center.', b"Perfect for my Yoga 920.  I've gone through so many bags and sleeves and none of them fit properly (space inside so it moves around).  This one is PERFECT.  I like the side entry and fits like a glove.  The padded sides touch all edges of my 920.  The front pockets were perfect to put my pens, external DVD player, brick power supply, and multiple cables.  Still has room to spare.The only tiny knock I'll make (but not enough to take out a star) is that the blue is lighter than the picture.  Still looks fine and matches the Star Wars cover of my laptop.I also love that this is a slim case.  Easy enough to use like a slip case but with a handle and strap.Love it!", b'Just got this, so I can\'t vouch for long-term durability, but it looks to be high quality and durable construction with more padding than one usually sees in a sleeve-type case. The shoulder strap is plain webbing which I consider a plus because it will fold up small and tight if needed, and it has a high quality strap pad which will support more weight than you can possibly fit in this bag. The strap pad snugs tightly to the strap, meaning the strap isn\'t going to roll or tangle under the pad and the pad will stay where you put it on the strap. All zippers are installed correctly and work easily. Pockets are well sewn. In all, an impressive bit of design and engineering that is well executed.Two bones to pick, but not taking off any stars. Not what I like, but for other folks this might be exactly what they want.1. From the photo, I thought I\'d have more room in the front pockets than what is there. The pockets don\'t have much depth, and without gussets won\'t expand at all. Both front pockets have internal pockets for a pen and other small items you don\'t want rolling around in the main pocket, but if you put much of anything in the internal pocket, there won\'t be room for that bigger item you want to put in the main pocket. In the left (bigger) pocket I\'ve got a (Lenovo) power adapter attached to an APC PnoteProc8 surge protector (small, 600 Joules, highly recommended), AC cord in the main pocket, and a Yoga mouse (very thin) in the internal pocket.  In the right pocket I\'ve got an SD card reader, thumb drive, USB-C to USB-A adapter, and a pen in the internal pocket plus a business card wallet and phone charging cable in the main pocket. On the one hand, that is a full complement of what I need for travel, but on the other hand, that small complement of items completely fills both pockets. Both are on the edge of bulging with that load, and adding even one more small thing will overstuff the pockets, making them hard to close and causing the contents to possibly dig into your laptop despite the generous padding. That photo showing the pockets overflowing with goodies as if everything they show could fit in there is just B.S.  If you have more than what I describe, look for a different case. And note that the shoulder strap, which on a sleeve-style bag like this will mostly be carried in one of the pockets to be used only when traveling with overly-full hands, cannot fit in either pocket given what else I\'m carrying.  Tomtoc should have further differentiated this case from their non-shoulder-strap version by including pocket gussets on this model. A definite missed trick, even though that also would have increased the price.2. The max internal dimensions they list for the case are a bit misleading.  You can have one dimension at the maximum 12.8" or  the other dimension at the maximum 9.14" but not both. The problem is the really nice (read protective) edge padding, which is rounded at the corners.  My Lenovo Yoga 920 measures 12.68" x 8.81" and it just fits.  (Indeed, if I overstuffed the pockets, I would expect the fabric pulling on the inside faces of the pockets to cause the laptop to fit poorly and make the laptop zipper hard to close.)The padding and pockets make this thing thicker than a typical sleeve, but it still feels like a sleeve.  If you aren\'t carrying more than I describe, this case is the ticket.  At this price ($30 when I purchased), it\'s hard to go wrong.', b'I purchased this case for my new 15" MacBook Pro with touch bar- it fits nearly perfectly and is super snug. The pockets on the front hold the charger and some other stuff with room to spare,  and it seems to be durable and well made.', b'This is a great bag I use it to hold my mbp15\xe2\x80\x9d. In the side pouches I hold the mbp charger my phone and phone charger. The reason for the lower rating is that the stitching for the strap is starting to tear off. I have bought it end of October so it has been a little over a month of use and it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to fall apart.  I do use the bag on a daily basis for work and school. Was hoping for the strap to last longer. I will continue to use the bag as I like it a lot. But would prefer if the stitching was made to last longer than a month.', b"Love it. Looks very nice. Pretty slim (not too bulky). Did not own it for long but quality seems to be good. I can fit in there my 15.6 inch Yoga 720 with the power supply and medium sized mouse in separate compartments and still will have room for portable HDD. and some small accessories. The only thing is that the main pocket for the laptop is not on the top but on the side, so it came in a bit of surprise for me. I'm guessing they made that way so they can fit the handle on top which is very convenient.", b'After researching all possible carry bags for my new 13" 2017 MacBook Pro, I decided on this case because of the reviews and the style of the bag. I particularly liked the outside pockets which seemed perfect for peripherals like my mouse. I definitely made the right choice. My new MacBook Pro fits perfectly, and it\'s completely protected in this high quality case. I couldn\'t be more satisfied with the bag.After it arrived, however, I realized that many reviews stated how it came with a mousepad. This wasn\'t critical to me, but I sent a quick email to Tomtoc asking if a mousepad should\'ve been included. This was just a few days ago, and today in the mail, a mousepad was delivered! It\'s thin and just the right size so that it fits easily into the bag. I\'m delighted with the customer service of this company, and Tomtoc will be the first place I\'ll go in the future if they have the product that I\'m looking for. I highly recommend this bag and this company!']}

There's a lot of flex when opening and closing and it's hard to get a gauge on how durable it will be over time. Also the big sticker on the palm rest left a terrible residue when I pulled it off.

It's replacing my Asus Zenbook, but I'm not sure the faster processor and bigger screen is that much of an improvement. The battery life seems significantly shorter than the Zenbook and the i7 processor isn't really a noticeable improvement over the i5 for my uses. If you do a lot of gaming or something I'm sure the better processor makes a difference, but if you're a student and do a lot of writing, web research, that sort of multitasking, etc, the i5 is fine. If I had to do it again, I'd probably save a little money and get the newer Zenbook. This is still a great little laptop that works fast and smooth, and really quiet so far with very little fan noise. I just thought the bigger screen and faster processor would be worth the extra money (about $50 over the Zenbook, as it's priced right now), but the added weight and shorter battery life essentially make it a wash.", b'Great speed, very light, has all the bells and whistles, except for CD drive.', b"I received the laptop on 6/18/18, when it came the box was damaged on one of the corners.

This morning I took it upstairs, zero bars, no connection.Has to be defective. I looked up a review site and saw the intel 8265 is the wireless board in this laptop. Sooo, I carefully removed the bottom screws and gently unsnapped the bottom, until the keyboard surface came off. I saw the board right in there and there was tape on top of the antenna connectors, BUT I could clearly see the connectors were NOT plugged in at all!!! The pic I took clearly shows that. I used tweezers, plugged them in, and powered up. Low and behold, GREAT reception everywhere. So if you're in this boat and have no reception, this is why.I had this as a 5 star, but sadly, lost one star for this. If I was not handy and experienced with computers and fixing them, this would be a defective laptop.---------------- now back to the original review.I was not expecting this level of refinement in a mid priced laptop.Pros:- Light. Not at all heavy.- Sturdy metal construction. I love the feel of the brushed metal surface.- Hinge that rolls all the way around is stiff enough to hold the screen in any position, yet magically gives way to pressure from my fingers to roll over.- Keyboard: Wonderful travel, feel, the keys are larger than my HP and feel so good.- Sound: Wow! In any position, loud, very clear sound quality,- Speed: Intel i7 is so fast. So amazing to have this updated processor.- Display is beautiful. more than I could ever need. very clear and colors, great. There's a little tinge of yellow, which is far better than the blue on my HP.- Wake time: Almost instant with the ssd. Cannot ask for more.- Battery life: I have not been able to make it run out yet. Crazy good.- Fingerprint lock... perfect and repeatable.- Large RAM, 16G vs other's 8G. Makes it pop even faster.- No fans have come on with heavy use. Stays cool on the bottom. So good.- Backlit keyboard is adjustable (Press Fn key and then the adjustment button to raise/lower keyboard brightness)- Works well with my penCONS- I have never loved shiny screens... lots of fingerprints. I mean come one guys, all this amazing work and you make a touchscreen this shiny? I have to look THROUGH fingerprints?!- Seems like the wifi is a bit weaker than my other computer. But works. Just less bars **** This was updated aboveThat's all I can pick at!This is by far the best laptop I've ever had. Very happy"]}

We purchased several mouses in the past and needed a replacement for a wired mouse that was old and lost connection often. We had similar wireless mouses in the past, but this one so far works great. Honestly the best part about this mouse is the silent clicking. For those of you who have a spouse or significant other, you know what we\'re talking about. The click sound on regular mouses will drive them crazy and this mouse is absolutely quiet. The only "clicking" sound that you could hear is from the middle scroller that "clicks" while you hit it. Other than that, it is completely silent. You need 1 AA battery to operate this. The design is smooth to the touch and it\'s quiet ergonomic in the grip.Our rating scaleDesign: 5/5Utility: 5/5Effectiveness: 5/5Noticeable flaws: We can\'t find any!Suggestions: Perfect mouse!Our answers to the frequently asked questions:When the USB transmitter/receiver is inside the mouse, does that turn the mouse off completely?Yes it does!Does the scroll wheel/ball allow for horizontal/side-to-side scrolling, or just vertical up and down?Vertical only. It is not a free range wheel.Does the scroll wheel move in increments and click or does it move smoothlyYou will hear the scroll a bit when you increment it up and down if you\'re going fast, but will hear "less" of a noise when you move it slowly.Overall, a silent and one of the best mouse that we\'ve tried so far. Great for gamers and late night work hours. We highly recommend!Like our review? Hit the "Yes" button below for it being useful. Leave us a comment if you have any questions or send us an email. Thanks for reading!', b"For the first five minutes I liked this, then it started causing big trouble with my computer.  I couldn't open most websites and my defrag utility wouldn't work.  I was ready to take the laptop into the repair shop when I thought I would try one more thing.  I took out the USB for the mouse and my computer ran perfectly.UPDATE:  The company saw my review and contacted me.  They said they had never had this problem before and sent me their newest version, free.  The new one works great!  Maybe it was just a fluke.  I appreciate how the company took ownership of the problem and made it right.", b'Very annoying. It "turns off" easily (requiring a tap of a button to begin working again) responds unevenly, occasionally skips and/or fails to move with a first push on the mouse pad. While the battery lasts a long time, I\'d much rather have a mouse that works all the time.UPDATE: VicTsing noticed my problem in this comment and quickly replaced the faulty mouse. So far, the newly designed replacement works fine. I would give it five stars as it works well for a very inexpensive mouse, except for the poor quality control on the original.', b'This is a decent wireless full size mouse. When you plug it in, you just click to get it to connect. It uses only a single AA battery and the nano receiver has a convenient storage spot next to the battery. It works great on my iMac, too. It is about the same size as the iMac wireless mouse, but it is a tad taller. I like that it goes to sleep to save battery life. To wake the mouse, just click. With most other mice like the iMac mouse, the buttons can be accidentally pressed when the mouse slides into another object like the keyboard. With this mouse, the buttons are shrouded by a plastic edge that protects against accidental clicks. This mouse feels good and and works well. For the price, I am thinking about replacing my other mice with this model.', b'This was a very bad purchase. How can you get a computer mouse wrong? I purchase this for a birthday gift to complete a laptop accessory bundle I was putting together. I went to put the battery into this mouth however they forgot to put any type of metal At the ends of the battery placement so no electricity could be generated. Way to mess up a invention that has been around for a very long time.', b"Update 4/9/2017 - Just an update about cleaning. After months of heavy use, it was time for an internal cleaning. Often this signals the end of a mouse as it never goes back together (if you can even get it apart). This model proved the opposite. There is a single screw at the back bottom, then you gently pry off the top. After that, there are 4 tabs to pull back to release the top cover. Then it is just a matter of cleaning.The re-assembly is just as easy and the re-fit is just as tight as when original. A single small phillips head screwdriver is all that is really needed but a jeweler's flat head helps. I was pleasantly surprised at the logic in the design and construction and have a really clean mouse to work with again.No change in 5 star rating!********I like this mouse. it has a far lower profile than the old (and I mean **old**!) HP wired mouse that I was using. I also had a wireless mouse from another vendor that I passed on as it simply was erratic.This mouse has decent precision, light to the touch but you feel like you have something in your hand. It paired with no issues and has been working flawlessly with Win10 for a while now. It does seem to go into a sleep mode of sorts, but a simple click wakes it.If you just need a basic wireless mouse without all the bells and whistles, this one works great."]}

Thank you for a high quality. beautiful piece.", b'Awesome, well-made bag. Very good quality for the price.

I followed the instructions exactly as to fully charging the battery pack and allowing it to discharge down to 7% for the first 3 times before actually using the computer.

This review will be updated once I have had time to truly test the product.That being said....Pros:Delivered on time and in good condition.Nice / fair price point for this product.Contained instructions / first charge cycle / usage card that (and this is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT) is legible with large print, grammatically  correct and in English. I have purchased WAY too many electronics I could not read the instructions (even with magnification) and those that I could magnify where in broken English and not easily followed.Cons:If there are any, I will modify this review.', b"So far so good. Replaced the factory battery in a Dell laptop with this one and the computer recognized it without any problems at all. I'm getting anywhere from 2.5 to 3 hours or so of life out of this batter on a full charge and that is about what I would expect. Of course that is with continuous use. It sure beats the heck out of spending 4 or 5 times as much for a direct factory replacement. Quality is top notch. It seems just as well built as the factory original. I can't tell the difference. So far so good.", b"Working good so far on old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1545. I'm also using a new Dell PA-21 65Watt Adapter for it, which is same as old stock Adapter. The new battery didn't recognize the old adapter so I was lucky enough to find same one on Amazon \xf0\x9f\x98\x80", b'Purchased for a several year old Dell Inspiron. The computer is seldom used but battery life never was very good. To be fair it may not have been "seasoned" properly, but in last year or two, life was down to about 10 minutes. The new battery has restored life to two and a half hours or more. Needless to say, quite happy with it.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

I see no reason to pay more for a larger SSD when I can easily add a 1TB drive for $50.I do wish Dell would follow other manufacturers and add a simple compartment on the bottom for upgrading the hard drive and RAM. Instead they cover one screw with the service tag requiring you to pierce it to take the bottom off. I find that to be a horrible business practice. Hey Dell, the 90\'s are over and people want to upgrade their laptops themselves without paying some overpriced "service tech". I guess the threat is that it will void the warranty.

I don\'t know who "certified" this refurbishment, but I have a very difficult time believing it was apple. Returning for a refund.', b'Its works okay as expected. I understand that I ordered a refurbished product but it was full of dents and scratches. Letters came off that we had to glue back. The picture that was advertised is not the same as what was delivered. Disappointed at this one.Update 9/14/17After purchasing this in August 2, it stopped working today. I would give 0 stars if I can. Support says return period ended Sept. 1.', b'Owned and configured by "Raleigh County School District"', b"Just received and doesn't even work Amazon should be ashamed  I had a blank screen since I powered it on", b'I purchased 4 of of these laptops.When I received them, one had an international keyboard, one had a broken mini port, and one of the chargers quit working after two days. What a horrible experience.', b"Basically it is an old version, yes. It doesn't work fast.But, I have changed RAM and HDD. I mean, I upgraded hardware.Put 16 GB RAM and 128 GB SSD. Now it is as fast as brand new macbooks. I may even claim that it is faster than new ones!So if you buy, upgrade it. That is it.", b"Buyer Beware. The first sign that something wasn't right was that this product is not being sold by Apple. I took my chances...tried to save some money. On arrival everything started fine, but definitely seemed pretty slow compared to our previous MacBook Pro. First sign of real trouble came when I downloaded Microsoft Outlook for my work e-mail. The computer couldn't handle it. Spinning beach ball time. Force quit (took a long time)... uninstalled Outlook and things went back to working, but remained slower than a normal Apple. Wife (already skeptical) told me to return it while it was still under Prime return policy. I balked. Held out (again being cheap). Computer worked well enough for about a month that I was OK with it for the cost savings being somewhat slow. Suddenly nothing worked. Literally you would move the trackpad (mouse) and the spinning beach ball would appear. Couldn't even scroll far enough to open a program without the beach ball endlessly spinning. Return policy became a little tricky. Fortunately the product was backed with a 90 day warranty. It took a couple call to Amazon customer service to: A) Return the product B) Get a full refund (they tried to apply a restocking fee). In the end was fully refunded which I appreciate greatly, but would not recommend purchasing.", b'Equipment totally defective, use it 02 times and then it did not turn on again. make the return of the product. has already been returned to the amazon warehouse in USAProduct Not recommended. bad']}

I travel a lot and use my computer on planes, trains, in coffee shops, malls, and sometimes in my office. I have had my current HP for 7 years and it has always performed nicely. I bought a Lenovo 3 years ago as a replacement because my HP was starting to slow down and I am impatient. The screen developed a line across it just after a year. Multiple screws fell out of the case and it started getting buggy. I switched back to my HP and it performed without any problems. The more I researched the more I went back to HP.When I received the package the outer box was undamaged but the original box the computer was packed in had significant damage and my first thought was I had to return it. The second thought was why would they ship a computer in a box with that much damage. I took pictures and prepared to return the computer. I travel a lot for work and do not spend much time in the United States and the next time I will be in the country is in June of 2018 so I thought if the computer works and is not damaged I will keep it. I took the computer out of the packaging and there were no visible signs of damage. I plugged it in and started it up and everything worked just like it should. Everything is tight with no scratches.The computer is light and looks like it has a metal chassis. It feels solid and not flimsy like some other brands. About 2 hours after I finished setting it up I stepped outside for a minute and my granddaughter pulled the computer off the table onto the hardwood floor. She did not get hit with the computer and my wife quickly moved her to another room and picked up my computer. She was afraid it was broken. After looking the computer over the only damage is to one of the corners. The computer is still solid, and works just fine. I am very happy with it and will look at HP again next time I buy a computer.I timed the battery life and with normal use with no gaming and only light video streaming it lasted more than 8 hours. I expect the time to go down some over time but if I get half the performance I got out of my old HP I expect the battery to last during most of my out of office time and during all but the longest flights.I only gave 4 stars because the damage done to the box. There were three items in the Amazon box when it arrived and this one was in the middle so it was not damaged in transit. It had to be damaged prior to shipping.', b'So i bought this laptop because my 15\xe2\x80\x9d hp laptop of 6 years died on me. I needed something for college and for movies and lookswise its really nice! It runs great too. But my only complaints is how the touch pad feels, it has that irritating feel that you get when you touch computer paper (if you know what i mean). & the laptop has this noise, like you can hear the laptop running basically. Its not super loud but its noticeable. I bought this to also give a real review on it and to post pictures of how it looks since no one seems to have it on youtube -.-', b'This computer is sleek in design and very compact. It\xe2\x80\x99s everything I needed it to be. I have an Ethernet port, micro sd port, and more than enough USB ports. For a small computer, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than I expected and it runs excellent. The i7 is also a big plus! Thanks HP!', b"This computer arrived promptly, the box was in excellent condition. I upon opening and turning on the computer for the first time, I had just over 80% battery life left for operating. I noticed that this computer was not exactly crisp with moving window to window and transitioning from one program to another. I need this to multi task for school and although this does the job, I am sad to say it isn't as quick as I was hoping for. For  a few hours everything and then windows and other updates were prompting. I started to update programs and had an error with HP accelerometer program. I successfully deleted the program restarted the computer and reinstalled a newer driver edition. NOW everything is running without any issues.The battery life is very disappointing and the fact that HP states 9hrs of operating is just crazy. I have on a full charge been lucky to get 4.5 without the backlit keyboard and with power saving options selected.Overall I do recommend this computer if you are in need of something that is very light weight and easy to carry around, just make sure to bring your charger. I like how it doesn't contain a lot of bloatware that all too many computers to date seem to provide.", b"First, the keyboard is backlit.  Press the F5 key and there you go.  Honestly, this is a superb laptop, especially for me.  It's fairly light weight, very easy to use, more storage than just about any human could use, a lot of great features.  I would have loved to own this thing five years ago.  There's nothing cheap or flimsy about it.  I read other reviews about a noisy fan, but I'm not hearing it and my hearing is very good.  Maybe it was a later improvement on the model?  I don't know, but this thing is as silent as it gets.  Seriously, this is a very nice computer.  Yes, there is no DVD drive, but you can buy one to USB attach for less than $40, so that shouldn't be too big of a deal.  And, oh yeah, a very good keyboard.  Excellent key feel makes typing very comfortable.", b"It's very nice looking computer. The screen is sharp and the back lit keys are nice. It came with allot of bloatware. It periodically freezes upand sometimes loads slow. I never know when this is going to happen.. It's really a problem when I have to write an email report for my work and it does this. If I can't send a simple email when I need to, what good is it. I don't think I can send this back. I'm just sick about it. My advise is, buy a Dell.", b"I've been using this laptop for a little over a month now and I'm satisfied. My biggest concern when choosing to buy another HP Pavilion was with overheating but this model stays cool. I love how sleek and light it is and even with all the bloatware it boots quickly. I gave it 4 stars because the battery life isn't as long as I would like but it really isn't bad.", b"Wasn't standard silver like in the photo but more a goldish silver.Kinda threw me off.So far so good. I love the keyboard. Speaker volume is ok as well.Functions well so far for the purpose."]}

The laptop and tablet inside it were both protected and dry.', b'I am very disappointed  first day I am using this and the zipper is broken - perfect size but I am disappointed in the quality and hope I can return itI am updating this review as the seller has contacted me and is doing everything they can to make it right - that is customer service and I may re purchase this product as they are so helpfulMay 2017- UPDATE- I am using a newer version of the bag and the zipper has been MUCH IMPROVED.  I cannot say enough about the seller and their commitment to customer service.  They took the feedback about the zipper and fixed it - GREAT JOB love this backpack', b'Fairly comfortable, multiple compartments fit both my 14.1" laptop and 10" tablet pc, with chargers and other gears like hdmi cables, flash drives, etc. I live in an area where summer temperature easily goes over 95, so can\'t say much about the mesh- I\'d sweat with any backpack.. But the straps are sturdy enough to hold up the weight of my books, laptops, stationeries and water bottle, so that\'s great! I like the front little pocket to put things I could easily grab, like keys or earphones - things I\'d need to reach while on the go with things in my hands already.I have not had a chance to try out the usb port for the portable battery (not included), but I do think is a cool feature and is one of the reasons why I bought this bag.The lock that comes with the backpack works fine, haven\'t had a reason to put it to use yet; I figured it\'d be more useful in situations like travelling or having to leave your backpack in a public library while you go to the bathroom or something. But hey, free lock- use it for your gym locker if need be.All in all, a great, sturdy backpack with lots of different pockets in different sizes to make compartmentalizing your iteams fairly easy and convenient. Just what I needed!', b"I purchased this backpack only because a different model I wanted was sold out, and wasnt coming back into stock anytime soon. I cancelled the order, and was hesitant, but I liked how this bag looked, so i went for it. So happy I did. I had two backpacks before this, a small VANS bag with no pockets, and a bulky swiss gear with tons of compartments. I loved how the vans was small, and loved how the swiss had pockets, but this backpack is perfect. It's seriously the best of both worlds. It's a perfect size to hold things, but not so huge that its obnoxious to tote around. The front slanted pocket is perfect for quick finds like my gloves/ID for work, and the inside pockets are what I use for my wallet/phone. The included lock is meh, but it didnt really matter as I had bag locks anyway. The material feels strong and well made, and the zippers caught my attention. They're solid and wont break anytime soon. The side pouches are a nice touch for waters/things you need right away. It's stylish, functional, and despite having it for only a week, im in love with it. My only gripe with this bag is sometimes when you sling it over your shoulder, the straps adjust themselves/fall out of where you had them. It's a little annoying, but you learn how to avoid it. A perfect product that I would buy again. The included USB port for charging is such a nice touch that I didnt know I needed until I had it. I pair it with my cocoon grid it organizer and its perfect. Even full its bot heavy. Awesome awesome awesome bag!!", b'One of the best tech bags of 2017! The Mancro Innovation tech backpack is comfortable, spacious, has great built-in tech, and is affordable!', b'I had a more sporty sling bag before for work and the stitching was coming apart.  I was in need of a new bag and I like the look of this one .  I can fit all my stuff with room to spare and can fit folders or binders in the main pocket. This is usually a problem with the triangular shape of a lot of the sling bags. A great bag for the price.']}

Amazon plainly states that refurbished electronics should be reconditioned to look and function like new.At BEST, my laptop might qualify for the USED --Upgraded category. It seemed to have had a new hard drive and extra ram installed. And yes, it included Windows 10. But a few hardware upgrades do not count towards Amazon\'s clear definition of "refurbished."My computer arrived with serious cosmetic flaws. The unit had clearly been dropped at some point, as the scuff marks and dented casing were obvious on one corner, and loads of other scrapes and scuffs all around. Instead of being in "like new" condition, the computer looks like it was on loan from someone\'s little brother. The screen wobbled like the hinge mounting screws were loose, and the LCD itself had numerous dead pixels. The keyboard looked fine at first, but once I started typing, a sticky film appeared that I had to scrape off key-by-key because my fingers were sticking to the keys. Who knows what that stuff was!Worst of all was the battery. At the very least I\'d expect a refurbished laptop to come with a brand new battery. However, I noticed almost immediately that the battery drained quickly. After running the configsys battery report, I discovered that this battery was already down to 50% of its capacity, meaning that a full charge lasted only half as long as it should and that the battery was well on its way to being spent. This was the deal breaker. It is completely unacceptable that a product advertised as "certified refurbished" be shipped in such poor condition.I\'ve reached out to the seller for an explanation, but have not received a response. (Funny, since they seemed all too anxious to secure a five star review BEFORE I made my objections.) I will be returning for a refund. I strongly advise against purchasing this computer from this seller.', b"Everything the seller advertised was there - built-in webcam, HDMI port, etc. The vendor's product description was accurate. One review mentioned there wasn't a built-in webcam, but this laptop had one.I received the laptop yesterday and have been doing all the setup stuff to mirror my old Dell Win7 laptop, which I'm retiring. The laptop arrived on-time and was packed well. All that was in the box was the charger, the laptop, and the packing material. The laptop appears to be in pristine condition - no dings, scratches or blemishes. Once you get through the rather tedious initial boot up stuff (thanks Microsoft), you are greeted by a clean desktop that displayed only the recycle bin and Firefox (hurray!). The first software I installed was Classic Shell to rid myself of those annoying Win10 tiles and get a usable start menu. No extraneous software or crapware installed. Perfect! The computer is running fast and fine...for the moment. I will update this review should things change.One minor disappointment is that there is no microphone jack, though there is a headphone jack (I like to use a mic/earphone headset when doing Skype). That rather surprised me, but it is a minor complaint. The built-in mic works OK. The optical drive is read-only and knew that when I ordered, but I have an external burner (I rarely burn DVDs or CDs any longer). USB 3 would have been nice, but, again, I knew it was only USB 2, which is good enough. I haven't run the machine off the battery, so I don't know what condition it's in.With all the usual caveats, I recommend this refurbished laptop. I almost wish I had purchased another one (it only cost two average trips to the grocery store).UPDATE: Just a note that the Broadcom network adapter installed on this laptop is 802.11n. The adapter is 2.4GHz single band which means it is slower (dual band adapters are much faster). I have a network connection rated at over 100Mb/s, but I can only get download speeds of around 30Mb/s. This isn't necessarily a problem for most users, but it is a disappointment. For comparison my old Dell had a dual band adapter with download speeds of around 100Mb/s. Have removed one star in my rating. Nevertheless, it is still a good laptop for the money.UPDATE 2: To remedy the adapter download speed, I purchased a USB network adapter that can access the 5.8GHz band on my router. The cost of the adapter was $17 and it works great. Download speeds of up to 100Mb/s restored. Restoring my original rating of five stars to my review. The laptop is working great!UPDATE 3: After nearly seven weeks, the laptop is going strong. Having lived with it, I've not noticed anything unusual. Still very pleased with the purchase.", b"I love this laptop. Comes with everything you need: battery, charger, Windows 10, and setup takes 5 minutes. No glitching or anything; can't even tell it's refurbished. I'm happy it comes with a DVD player and webcam too. It's sturdy, and the hinges work smoothly- nothing feels like it'll break easily. The keys offer a smooth typing experience. The screen is bright and the sound is good and punchy.Altogether I'm in love with this laptop for all that it comes with for such a great price- you really cannot beat it."]}

{'asin': 'B001E42FZY', 'title': 'Lifestyles Of The Laptop Café by The Other People Place on Amazon Music - Amazon.com', 'price': '', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b'Classic Detroit Techno/Electro By the late great James Stinson! Filled with chilling bass lines and soothing and lush synths taking you to the eye of the storm and its eerie calmness!', b'If you lived in a laptop cafe, this is what it\'d be like. And LIFESTYLES OF THE LAPTOP CAFE, The Other People Place\'s only album release, straddles techno, electro and house with the greatest of ease. Whether you like things dark and deep ("Eye Contact") or with a smidge of romance ("It\'s Your Love"), the not-quite-there vocals add a fascinating texture. The songs are simple, but never simplistic, an important distinction to make. "Let Me Be Me" crashes so many styles that its title becomes an appropriate mantra. "Sunrays" closes out the album with more cohesive lyrics, but the warmth and the groove is what comes through most clearly. This is a lifestyle worth living.', b'T.O.P.P. has always been one of my favorite Drexciya side projects.Its some the last work of Drexciya done with James Stinson(RIP).This is a straightforward smooth detroit electro influenced album full of jazzy, atmospheric melodies,spacey sound effects, and eerie repetetive vocals, all about love of course. IMO its the most easily accessible Drexciya album for those not familiar with the duo.Playable all the way through and great for nighttime listening(it really isnt the same listening to this album in the daytime)I recommend getting this one especially while it is still in print at a reasonable price. All of Drexciya  and side projects with James Stinson are collectors items since he is deceased(Its also some very good techno that is emulated  to this day by artists worldwide). If you get this and like the Drexciya sound or you just want to complete the storm series get Shifted Phases,Drexciya-Harnessed The Storm,Abstract Thought,Lab Rat XL,and the 2 Transllsuion releases-I think they are all available on Amazon. Great Stuff.', b'A bit of a stretch yes...The latest addition to the Warp label debuts with "Lifestyles of the Laptop Caf\xc3\xa9" with their Detroit techno sound.  Enough of that nonsense, time for my own words.Each songs showcases their various traits, including a fascination with manipulated speech patterns to create... not quite a "MacinYorke" effect or even a Prefuse73 effect but just different.  One could complain that it gets too repetitive for its own sake but after all, isn\'t all techno based on that incontrovertible fact?I gave it four stars because I haven\'t given it enough time to let it grow and it\'s doesn\'t quite stand out compared to the other I have recently obtained (especially from Warp).  But because it\'s from Warp, I\'ll definitely give it my high praise (after all I haven\'t heard a really bad Warp album).If you want something off the beaten path, go for it.', b"For starters, this is straight up repetitive techno. It is not inspiring, it is not interesting, it is not innovative, and it is not very atmospheric. Overall its boring tripe. Nothing here that hasn't been done before and I'm very dissapointed in Warp for releasing this, its almost a slap in the face after hearing Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin, and Squarepusher. If you want some good decent techno, check out Juno Reactor or Speedy J."]}

{'asin': 'B00DU8W6DI', 'title': 'Amazon.com: Guerrilla Painter LapTop Painting Box, 9 by 12-Inch', 'price': '', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b"I've used this box for over a year now and I like it. When I first ordered it Guerilla Painter accidentally sent me the larger 9x12 Pochade box, so I had some time to compare both side by side. The Laptop is definitely a better choice if you value portability and light weight.I bike and/or hike to painting locations so I wanted something very trim. The Laptop allows me to have a full painting set up - 8-10 tubes, medium cups, brushes, pencil & ruler, knife, and gloves - and still thin enough to fit in a backpack with a tripod.  The only thing I need to carry externally is a small can for solvents and some paper towels.  Holds 2 panels easily - might hold 3 if you tweak the clips a little.People have complained about the lack of panel sizing and I can see that being annoying.  But the box is a sturdy foundation that could be easily hacked to fit specific needs.", b"Great for plein air painting! Fits all of my materials and is perfect for watercolor/gouache...It is a little heavy but, maybe I'm working with more than I need..?", b'Love it. Use it for plein air pastels. It has not disappointed me.', b"I found the box to be well constructed and clever in it's design.  It is my first Pochade box and as such, will always be something I remember fondly.  That said, I have found the limitations to be more than I am willing to deal with, so have ordered something else.  This box only holds 9/12 panels.  If you want to use the same panel as a 12/9...you will need to use clamps to keep it in place.  Once you add on the various accessories to make it more flexible you end up with a slightly less inflexible system--for the price of a high end system.", b'This was a great investment for plein aire painting. I had tried to make due with other choices, but then got frustrated and bought this one. The size is perfectly planned to hold all my stuff, and still be light enough to carry with me.', b'Beautifully made, easy to carry and use. The only problem is the knob does not tighten so you can put any degree of pressure on the canvas without it moving.']}

This laptop will zap your happiness and cost you time and money unless you're computer savvy.", b'I wish i had listened to the one star review saying the product that is being advertised and the one that is being sold is two different laptops!. The laptop I received is the lenovo idea pad 110. See for yourself below', b"This is a pretty decent budget laptop. It's not going to play a bunch of games, but it'll surf the net, it'll let you type out some documents, it's a handy device.I'm glad I bought it, it gets daily use in my home.", b"I've had this laptop for about 2 months now and I have to say it was worth what I paid for it.It's a $275 laptop so I didn't have high expectations on performance etcIt is rather slow if you load up multiple programs and tabs at the same time.  If you limit your multi-tasking to 2 or 3 programs, it runs rather smoothly.Gaming wise, I would not recommend it unless you are playing older games pre-2006.  I've tried running League of Legends on it, which is a popular game with rather low system requirements.  On low settings, I still had performance issues.There are only 2 usb drives which is annoying as most laptops have 3.  Also the slot where you plug in the power cord into the laptop is at an awkward location on the left side of the laptop.  The power plug also is designed very awkwardly, plugging it into a power strip, you'll notice that due to its size it'll take more space on it than a standard laptop power cord.Overall, if its a cheap laptop you're looking for.  This would come recommended.  If you're expecting longevity and performance, you will be slightly disappointing.", b"Had to return due to AT&T needing a digitally signed version of SPR Protocol Driver to provide Internet service. The software developer appears to be out of business so such couldn't be obtained. Thank goodness I realized the problem with 1 DAY LEFT FOR A FULL REFUND!! (:)"]}

I followed the instructions exactly as to fully charging the battery pack and allowing it to discharge down to 7% for the first 3 times before actually using the computer.  I think this stuff is very important as the battery would discharge quickly down to 7% which had me worried about the battery life. However, after performing 3 consecutive discharges to 7%, the battery life is a little over 4 hours which I am very pleased with!!!', b'Arrived early and was 91% charged.  Snapped perfectly into my 1545.  Followed the instructions about cycling from full charge before use and then recharging when discharged down to 7%.  Works like a champ.', b'only had it a few days but was fully charged ready to go and with the new cord I also bought with plug into computer that fit and stayed tight has put new life into my old computer. Very pleased and a great value.', b"It fit my old Dell laptop and has been working great. I honestly didn't expect it to work as well as it has been.", b'Since this is a battery, it will take at least one charge cycle before I can provide an actual review on product quality. This review will be updated once I have had time to truly test the product.That being said....Pros:Delivered on time and in good condition.Nice / fair price point for this product.Contained instructions / first charge cycle / usage card that (and this is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT) is legible with large print, grammatically  correct and in English. I have purchased WAY too many electronics I could not read the instructions (even with magnification) and those that I could magnify where in broken English and not easily followed.Cons:If there are any, I will modify this review.', b"So far so good. Replaced the factory battery in a Dell laptop with this one and the computer recognized it without any problems at all. I'm getting anywhere from 2.5 to 3 hours or so of life out of this batter on a full charge and that is about what I would expect. Of course that is with continuous use. It sure beats the heck out of spending 4 or 5 times as much for a direct factory replacement. Quality is top notch. It seems just as well built as the factory original. I can't tell the difference. So far so good.", b"Working good so far on old 2009 Dell Inspiron 1545. I'm also using a new Dell PA-21 65Watt Adapter for it, which is same as old stock Adapter. The new battery didn't recognize the old adapter so I was lucky enough to find same one on Amazon \xf0\x9f\x98\x80", b'Purchased for a several year old Dell Inspiron. The computer is seldom used but battery life never was very good. To be fair it may not have been "seasoned" properly, but in last year or two, life was down to about 10 minutes. The new battery has restored life to two and a half hours or more. Needless to say, quite happy with it.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

My other tablet/laptop hybrid experiences had been bad.But I can honestly say this is perfect for my needs.  It is very good for annotating PDF files and the pen is more responsive than I expected. It is a little heavy to be used one handed, but it's large enough to brace against your body. I've gotten more arm strain from much smaller lighter devices.As a laptop the keyboard is well sized and easy to type on. All the keys are well placed. My only complaint is that there is no 10 key on the side, but with this size that wouldn't be possible.Battery life is decent, probably 4-8 hours. It multitasks well, I've watched videos with multitab chrome running in the background. Speaking of chrome, it runs great until you get about 12-15 tabs up. Then it get's a little slooooow.

It's a little difficult to take pics with the rear facing camera (unless you're taking a selfie), but that's not a deal-breaker. Also, she was upgrading from an Android ASUS, so she didn't have access to the apps she had been using. To remedy this, we unstalled an Android emulator on this system. Now she has all of her old Android apps, along with the new Windows apps.", b"First of, the laptop I received had a battery defect so I requested for a replacement the very next day I got it. I received the replacement after 2 days and I fell in love with the features especially with the price. I only use it for the basic stuff and it isn't that fast but I'm fine with it. But after 2 weeks of use, one of the hinges became misaligned rendering it unable to be closed without breaking it. I wasn't being careless or anything, I was just closing it like I usually do and I just heard a something crack all of a sudden. I am very disappointed with the quality of this one. It's hinges are supposed to be one of the strongest parts since it transforms into a tablet. I just hope I'll be able to return this and I will definitely get a more pricey one. Just waiting for asus to respond to my email.", b'Updated it to Pro immediately. All the updates took all day. A little quirky at times but seems to be very handy.']}

I purchased it because it was marked as prime, then went and paid additional $$ for it to be delivered in 1 day instead of the 2 day offered with prime. Only after purchasing and shipping was i then informed that it would take a full 7 days to get here.Only after contacting amazon was i given my refund for shipping. I still had to wait 7 days, though and was told while emailing amazon that the item would only count as prime in the state of California.That's false advertising and i'm not happy about it at all.The laptop itself, on the other hand? really great. I've only had it a few hours but i love it so far. All games i've tried have played smoothly with no issues. Gorgeous screen, much prettier than the one on my old lenovo y50-70. The biggest complaint i have is the sound...it comes out underneath the laptop, which is strange and creates a rather crappy, muffled noise but with headphones it shouldn't be an issue. overall, i'm really happy with this laptop. I still haven't had the chance to download and test the big test game for me...Ark...so i'll update this with how it runs Ark at a later date, as that game my old computer couldn't run smoothly.", b"My first gaming laptop.  Although I really bought it for the graphics, hard drive, lit keyboard, etc. Was once into gaming, maybe I'll get back into it. So far, impressed with this laptop. Hard core gamers may have different opinions.", b"I am happy with this purchase and so far zero issue with it. I enjoy the red back lit keys and has the F1 through F10 keys as well. It fired up quickly. The few games I play runs great (Empyrion is one I play most). Load time was quick. The graphics very nice too. The laptop fan settings was nice to have access to set the speed. You have full control on alot of stuff from turning on or off the onboard camera, microphone, wifi, and Bluetooth. It comes with Norton Internet security although not a big fan. I will use for now. Otherwise I would buy another MSI laptop again. The company I bought it from shipped it fine and I wish they would use more packaging stuffing it it's box. I did not receive it damaged nor the boxes it was in. Updates as the weeks progress.", b'Great gaming laptop! I often see people writing "great for the price," but this machine does not need the qualifier. The price is good, but that is not what makes the machine good. It runs very smoothly, stays cool, is very quiet, and sturdy. My old laptop simply did not have the power to run a game that my friend always wanted me to play with her FF14. I tried it and just had constant stops and starts and long lags. This machine runs it at highest graphic settings without a single hiccup. I\'m very pleased and would definitely purchase another MSI machine were I in the market for another new computer. By the way, although it doesn\'t add anything to the way the computer operates, the red backlit keyboard is very cool! If there were anything I could say in criticism it would be that the machine does not have a DVD drive, but other than that, terrific computer!!', b'Arrived early and as expected from EXcaliberPC. They did awesome. But, after 2 weeks the HDD failed. I meticulously took care of this, it was only used on a desk and kept in the box when not in use. I am in the process of getting the RMA done. Apparently I have to pay for shipping one way and it will leave me without a computer for 30+ days. That is a BUMMER. I did not abuse this thing, it was a defective item. Yet I have to pay for shipping and wait for them to OPEN it up, poke around and hopefully fix it. I would rather just get a new one since this had problems right out of the gate. I have always heard good things about MSI. I guess I will see how this works out for me because I feel pretty let down and may try other brands next time.', b'Great gaming laptop. Play league on high quality with 100-110 FPS. Crashed on playing left 4 dead tho, not sure why. ( probably overheated haha) but worth every penny that I spent. I\xe2\x80\x99m really satisfied with this laptop \xe2\x98\xba\xef\xb8\x8f', b"this is a great computer I love using it. The speed is incredible. If you don't like the red light background for the keyboards you can switch it off or lower the setting. The only thing I would say is because it is such good quality the videos that are poorer quality show a difference when watching. as a result if the quality of the film is not the greatest it may show up more pixelated. other than that it's awesome. Another great feautire is you can turn on and off your webcam feature.", b'Really good laptop, especially if you can find the sale for $150 off. Absolutely cannot beat the value.Runs Fortnite at a consistent 95 fps with shadows and anti-aliasing at lowest setting, with everything else set for the highest setting (very powerful cpu and gpu). Has more than enough storage to hold all your games and other files. Boots up super fast.Looks great, keys are smooth, display is great.Kinda heavy, but not an issue for most people.I saw reviews saying that theirs came with dead pixels, mine did not.Definitely happy with this purchase.']}

But I needed a new laptop for school and music production and it's rare to find a laptop with an actual graphics card higher than a 960M for this price.A few points:This DID come with 8GB DDR4 RAM, a 4GB GTX 1050 (not the Ti edition), and a 1TB hard drive. It does support up to 32GB RAM using 2 16GB sticks, and is upgradeable through a door on the bottom.Pros:-This laptop feels sturdy and solid. I love the red accents and the solid black main body color.-The graphics card has handled the light gaming I've done with it with flying colors. So far, I've tested Portal 2 at maxed out settings and it's done roughly 180-200fps. LA Noire at all maxed settings keeps a steady 30fps (it's frame locked), Metro 2033 at maxed settings runs at roughly 45fps.-The Intel i5 has been a solid CPU for it as well.-The wifi uses ac and b/g/n so it makes full usage of the 5ghz channel for wireless. The speed difference is night and day. I get almost triple the download speed using ac over b/g/n.-Battery life unplugged and surfing the internet is really good. 7-8 hours.Cons:-Ok, so this is my major issue and the only reason it's not getting 5 stars. The speakers are...not great. They advertise a subwoofer, but I'm not sure what the deal with that is since the bass on this is average at best. The speakers do tend to crackle and distort at higher volumes to the point where a musician like myself gets very annoyed. I'm actually debating on buying a bluetooth speaker to use instead.Overall, if you're looking for a solid gaming laptop, this is probably the best one I've found, but be aware that the speakers are not great and I almost feel like they dropped sound quality to increase graphics quality. It's a weird trade.", b'Where I can start, this has been my best laptop, the first days were a struggle, deleting the bloatware, updating drivers, downloading programs, passing file from my old laptop, the laptop was laggy sometimes, the laptop took a lot of time turning off and starting and I started to complain about my purchase, I had problems updating the Video Card, I didn\'t have administrator permissions, but those were little issues that I solved, then, updating all the things, drivers, setting the system for the best performance and following the instructions of others user, my laptop turned into a monster.It runs all the games that I want (Rainbow Six with all the settings full, GTA V in very high, PUBG in ultra settings,, etc) with 60+ fps and it\'s amazing. It doesn\'t overheat and now it starts really fast and it works great.I bought it for school, but I wanted something that could run some "heavy" games and this was more than I was expecting. This is my first "gaming" laptop and I\'m really happy with my purchase. Now I\'ll get a SSD and more RAM and it will be the perfect laptop for this price.[TIP]If your graphic card appears as Intel HD Graphics use this this tip to change it to GTX\'s card. (Thanks to -BigDaddy- for the help)1. Right Click on your desktop.2. Click NVIDIA Control Panel.3. Click Manage 3D Settings on the left menu.4. Click on the Preferred graphics processor drop down menu under the Global Settings tab.5. Select High-performance NVIDIA processor from the list.', b'Nice computer. Fast boot. Great graphics. Loaded Fallout 4, Lightroom and Photoshop. All performed flawlessly. BTW, the screen looks fine, after reading the reviews about people swapping out the monitor, I was expecting garbage. It really look good, and I edit photos for a living. It\'s not pro, and you do have to tilt it to the right angle, but it\'s nothing to worry about. Certainly would not even consider swapping it out. BTW, it does look awesome connected to my 32" Samsung. Fallout 4 on the 32\' looked great with this laptop. One tip, when you connect a second monitor via HTML, you will have to reselect the sound source, it defaulted to the HTML, even if it had no speakers.Also, after I did all the software updates, I was surprised to see the video source defaulted to the Intel onboard graphics, which will slow the system down. I had to go into the Nvidia settings and select the Nvidia graphics as the default for global settings. I thought that strange and might not have noticed if I hadn\'t run a benchmark and was surprised at how slow the graphics were until I changed the default.The BIOS settings are really dumbed down, not much to do there.The build is good, seems sturdy. It is not a light weight computer, but as a desktop replacement, I did not think it would be. Keyboard is good, and looks sharp with the red backlighting.Overall, very pleased, so far. I almost marked it down for having to fiddle with the Sound and video settings, and the consumerish BIOS, but it doesn\'t really detract from what seems to be a fine computer for the price. Highly recommended. It really is amazing the amount of computing power we can carry around in a small package for not much money.', b"Very good budget gaming laptop. Took out the 1TB HDD it came with, and threw in a 128GB SSD (which I just prefer speed over storage) and had an extra 8GB of DDR4 Laptop RAM so mine is a slight upgrade from normal, but that being said for the money it's a great portable gaming machine, obviously not as good as a desktop for around the same price, but pretty damn close. I get like 80s in PUBG, 150 in CSGO, and I didn't really bench more than that because I have my main gaming desktop for that, this is just for on the go. Overall it's good, monitor sucks, but that's what you have an HDMI port for, keyboard sucks, but most laptops have an awful keyboard in my opinion, and touchpad sucks, but nobody is going to use the touchpad for gaming. All in all I love it."]}

It came with a TN panel. I\'m not upset because it is what I expected. I contacted a few sellers before the purchase to verify. None of them could confirm an IPS panel just "15-inch FHD display". The one answered question above that states it is an "IPS" is from a seller that is selling a $999 model. To be honest the TN panel is great. There are a lot of screen snobs out there that just drool over the the letters IPS. In reality, the screen is fine. Don\'t stick your nose up to this unless you are some kind of graphic designer and truly need the "IPS" screen. I use this machine for programming, gaming, and media consumption and it works great. Also if anyone is interested, I purchased from coldriver20 and received a pristine product.', b'Gaming machines are Windows computers that actually work.  This is a very solid, sleek, fast laptop.Pros:- Fast i5 enhanced by a dedicated Nvidia 1050 GPU to take some load off.  The i5 in this machine benchmarks at 80% of the speed of an i7 @ 3.30GHz using CPU-Z in single threaded mode, but in mult-ithreaded mode the i7 is over 10x faster.  Some of that difference could be the laptop is running single channel memory from a single 8GB SODIMM, instead of a matched set of RAM cards in most desktops.  In real world use, Windows 10 is such a pig and so slow anyway, that installing a single, larger, cheaper SODIMM is the smart choice for overall performance, because having more slower memory is faster than having less faster memory.  But adding a second, matched 8GB 2400 SODIMM to bring the machine up to 16GB would likely speed up the machine some.- I think the design is gorgeous: simple, reasonably thin, very rigid- GREAT GREAT GREAT front facing speakers, for a laptop. Spacious stereo imaging and the laptop actually gets loud. There is even a little bit of genuine bass.  A lot better than low end external speakers, and on par with a Beats Pill.- Keyboard has a nice feel, and the backlighting is just right.  There\'s a little light bleed from around the keys that is inconsistently bright when viewed from a low angle, but overall the backlighting is good.- The IPS screen is impressively bright and sharp, but it is not nearly as colorful as my Dell Ultrasharp2913UW when attached as an external monitor (photo comparisons attached).  Note: the external monitor in the photos is being driven by the Nvidia chips and the laptop screen is being driven by the Intel chips, which might have some impact on color quality.  Yes, the color of the laptop screen is inferior to a pricey external monitor, but it definitely looks better than 90% of laptops out there, and it is an IPS unit, not a TN. Based on the poor screen reviews here, I thought this came with a TN screen so I bought a third party IPS screen model # AU OPTRONICS B156HAN01.1.  The replacement IPS screen was slightly less vibrant and less colorful than the Dell, plus it suffers from much worse light bleed near the corners and has two very annoying hot pixels right in the middle.  Both screens are AMAZINGLY sharp, much sharper even than my Dell 2913UW, but also a lot smaller with the same 1080 vertical resolution.  So the other reviewers are wrong, new Dell 7567s DO come with an IPS screen--confirmed.  The attached photo that is missing the laptop\'s screen bezel (white wiring exposed) shows the OPTRONICS B156HAN01.1 screen--the color and brightness is no better and the Dell\'s IPS screen, maybe worse.- Three USB 3.0 ports- Dell\'s great 7Amp external power supply.- Not too heavy and feels solid.- Supports a 4K second monitor. The 1050 drives the second monitor by default to provide excellent gaming speed and video editing power.- One screw, easy access to the RAM and HDD/SSD bays.  Awesome!Cons:- The Dell 5000 has the almost the same specs for $100 less, except the great gaming case and speakers, but that i5 is a gen behind and the screen is lower res.- Dell screwed up the bios settings, making  the exellent Samsung 960 M.2 Nvme SSDs incompatible at the motherboard level.  Depite the horror stories, I gave it a go anyway.  The Samsung SSD slides right into the empty slot (my config came only with a 1TB HDD).  Once installed and  unformated, the Dell sees it right away, so cloning the existing HDD boot patitition to the SSD is a breeze. But once formatted, the SSD disappears.  The trick was to return the BIOS to it\'s default settings. There is another option to return to "factory" settings---dont pick that one.  Now the Samsung M.2 SSD works great.  Boot time dropped from 39 secs to 19 secs.- The motherboard treats an advanced SSD as a basic SATAdevice, so Samsung\'s free  Magician software has none of the advanced, high speed features enabled.  Bummer.- The included 5400RPM mechanical harddrive is slow and it slows the whole machine to a chug.  I wouldn\'t even consider using this machine with Windows running off that hard drive--way too slow.Overall Conclusions:- Adding an 250GB SSD then cloning it to be your boot drive adds $150 but makes a huge difference running all applications under Windows 10.- The cheaper i5 is very competitive with the i7 in single threaded mode (productivity applications) but is only 9% as fast in multi threaded mode.So if you are buying this gaming laptop because the usual productivity-focused laptops are generally garbage, go for it.  If you are actually buying this for gaming, I would DEFINITELY spring for the i7 version, since it has an Nvidia 1050 ti instead of base 1050, has 10x faster multi-threaded CPU performance, and it comes with more RAM and a small SSD as standard.  That said, if the SSD uses the 2.5 inch drive bay, you\'re going to have to remove it for more storage and buy an m.2 SSD.Overall, this is a really great and satisfying laptop and I\'m glad I bought it.', b"Laptop arrived working well. Only issue was the speakers quality, but i tend to use headphones anyway.I had to get a laptop cooler because the computer heated up a lot when playing games. The laptop is very sturdy and the keyboard is great! I've been playing StarCraft II on it and running Adobe Illustrator.I did have a problem with it . After a month it became slow and the games froze up. I had tried using dell support assist and it seemed to make things worse, then a after a long windows update everything on the computer was erased and the desktop wasn't functioning at all. No menus would come up and it couldn't connect online.Dell customer support wasn't helpful (the free warranty only covers hardware issues, software help cost $250) , but I did a factory reset, cleaned registries, defragged, and some other things. I basically ended up fixing the computer myself and advice from a friend. Also I removed Dell Support Assist programs (the computer was working ok until I used it. I did some research and found that support assist is known for slowing down computers. There were 4 or 5 programs that were support assist).Ended up returning it. I need something reliable."]}

This review is for the HD version.  For the $229 I paid, the computer is a bargain.  It is thin and light and the display a pleasure to look at.  The keyboard does take a little force but it is not unreasonable.  The trackpad sensitive and supports two finger scrolling.  Yes, if you are typing, it is possible for the cursor to move due to unintended touches to the trackpad.  But as others have pointed out, the trackpad can be disabled using the F2 key.  The speaker are kind of tinny, but they are acceptable for the occasional sounds used by most programs.But the fact is that this is a very functional computer for replying to email and web browsing.  One thing I really appreciated is that it did not come loaded with any unneeded software.  There is a version of Office2016 that requires a purchase of a license, but it was easily deleted.  It says is comes with a 1 year warranty.  I am considering buying more of these for "thin client" applications because of the 4G of memory, high resolution screen and 64 GB solid state drive.', b'Ran a little slow..but then I disabled much of the Windows 10 bloatware, and it works much better.Can Cortana, and it works fine. Do wish it supported 5GHz wifi, but it only does 2.5.I use this primarily for news, movies, and cruising trash websites. I have it solely for that, so if it gets malware, I can simply wipe/reformat/reinstall.Keeps that sludge off my main working computer. Is a great option for that - affordable.', b'I guess I got what I paid for. If you want to do more than browsing the web this is not for you. Took over 3 hours to install windows updates, lagged all the time.Pros: Cheap, Nice screen quality, Decent sound. Looks Slick! Got in within 24 hours!Cons: Can barely handle running windows, lagged constantly. Maybe I just got a lemon...This is the first product I am ever returning to Amazon.. Was simply less then I expected based the hardware specifications. I would recommend a tablet instead as this is ONLY meant to browse the internet.', b'After my expensive 13.3 ASUS died on me for no reason, I\'m done buying expensive laptops!  I\'ve been looking for a LONG time for a laptop that has the following, and this one has all these things:1) Very reasonable price for the specs.2) Full HD screen.3) Great brightness even on "battery saver" mode.4) At least 64GB memory (wish it were a bit more and SSD but that\'s OK).5) VERY important - a keyboard that doesn\'t flex!!!  My expensive ASUS keyboard would noticeably flex and I\'m not a big fan.  The Fusion has a rigid plastic construction and the keyboard hardly flexes at all.  You have to push down REAL hard to notice anything.  Frankly I don\'t mind plastic construction so long as it\'s rigid and sturdy.6) Great size.  Even with a 14.1 screen this thing is the same size as my previous 13.3 ASUS.7) Not the lightest lapbook but light enough.8) Very good battery life.9) Doesn\'t lag when web browsing. Videos are smooth.Could it have a few more bells/whistes? Sure it could.  However, my biggest concerns were to have at least a 14" FHD screen, rigid keyboard that doesn\'t bend/flex, great battery life, at least 4GB RAM, and at least 64GB storage.  On all counts, this laptop succeeds.  If they release a more powerful version (ie., 128SSD and 8GB Ram, I\'d likely buy that too!).  I only got it a few days ago, but so far, I\'m very impressed.Update: One minor issue - the wifi is kind of slow and videos/streaming keeps cutting out!  I bought an adapter and hopefully that will help.', b"The laptop is good for the price.  The screen looks really good. It doesn't have piles of bloatware installed. It runs pretty fast. Overall I like it and it will serve my purposes.  My one complaint is about the trackpad.  The press to click function is for right and left clicking, there seems to be two buttons under the trackpad.  If  you are on the left side of the trackpad you can click on stuff by pressing down with the finger you are using to track.  If you are on the right side of the pad you will right click, so you have to use another finger to click on the left side.  I have been accidentally right clicking everything when I think I am on the left click side.  I will look at mouse options and see if I can set it up to left click everywhere and use a button to modify for a right click (like a mac)", b"The surface of it scratches too easy. I put a notebook on it while driving down the road and it got all scratched up. It even got dirty from the back of the notebook. The notebook had never seen a dirty surface and looked almost new. The cursor jumps all over the place while typing without you touching the mouse. Having to purchase micro soft apps just to have excel or word is ridiculous. The security system said i had 30 days but that wasn't true. It was already set to expire 2 days after i got it. The speed of the computer isn't to bad though.", b'A very nice computer. I like how easy it is to use. I like the size of the screen. It seems bigger than 14.1". Very light and easy to carry. I plan on using it for many fun things as well as for business. I would recommend Fusion5 to all my friends. They wanted $200 to replace the battery in my old computer so I decided to spend the money for a new one.

It came almost fully charged, which was very convenient during setup. The setup process itself was really easy to follow. So easy she was actually able to do it mostly by herself, and she is 11. It came all neatly packaged up inside of a box so it was safe during transport. There was a charge cord, the tablet, and the detachable keyboard included. It has 32 GB of memory, and an SD slot to expand. There is also an HDMI port which allows you to attach it to most smart tvs, and a USB port to attach other peripherals, such as a mouse, speakers, or additional storage as needed. The unit is pretty light weight and very portable. You can place the tablet facing either way on the keyboard, so if you want to use it like a small computer you can, or switch it and use the keyboard as a holder for the tablet.It snaps in and out of the keyboard cradle very simply. When off the charger, the battery life is over 5 hours. The 10.1 in screen is very clear and the touch aspect works like any other tablet. The rear facing camera is very clear and takes good pictures in low light. The front facing camera needs a good light source to be very clear. Otherwise, this is a good tablet combo for the price!', b'With being disabled and having a hard time sitting at the computer for any. Amount of time having the setup of this notepad being able to use a keyboard or being able to just use the screen is great it works really good for me thank you', b'I\'m a college student, and my laptop died mid semester. I figured I could use this in the meantime to type up papers, browse the web, and stream TV shows. For checking the news, reading ebooks, and browsing social media, it\'s great, and it does just fine for watching Netflix.However, if you do a lot of typing, and plan to write papers/essays/stories on here, you will be disappointed. The keyboard skips around, the mouse/trackpad is excessively sensitive, the trackpad will select and delete things while you are typing, and you\'ll want to tear your hair out. This is a nightmare when you have papers to submit for a deadline. Also, it has a "screen off" button on the keyboard right near the delete key, so when you try to delete your many typos, you have to deal with the screen constantly turning off and locking. Lovely.I am returning this product because it is essentially just a $100 Netflix machine at this point.Pros:-affordable-portable and lightweight-microSD slot is nice-cute purple color-Android OS is intuitive, easy, and highly customizable-battery life seems decent, universal charger is niceCons:-glitchy, barely-usable keyboard-many apps are incompatible with it-not a lot of storage-processor is a bit slowAside from the keyboard/trackpad, the product is not awful, and the tablet can be used detached from the keyboard. But it\'s barely able to be considered a notebook, it\'s not good for school, and is definitely not even a temporary replacement for a computer. If you plan on just reading, watching TV, and browsing FB, this will do just fine, but it isnt good for much else.', b'I bought one of these R.C.A. Tablets at Wal-Mart. Liked it so much, That I went on Amazon.com and purchased my wife one as a gift!!!! Also purchased 2 of the EEEKIT 5-IN-1 kits to protect our R.C.A. Tablets. All I can say at this point is, I LOVE MY R.C.A. Tablet!!!!!', b'This is a fun tablet, but not good for typing.  The keys are a close together and a little odd. The right shift key is 3 keys over to the right, you can not type fast.  You have to look at the keys while typing.  It works better with 2 fingers. This is a shame because there are 2 office programs. If you do not need this for typing this will not be a problem.  This tablet is pretty and is loaded with a lot of programs. It has 3 camera features and is also a video camera. The pictures it takes are clear and easy to upload on line.  It has a security system loaded in it. If you try to load an app that can be a risk or take a picture or video of you, the tablet warns you. It once stopped me from clicking on a share on facebook that was not secure. You can not delete tracking cookies without deleting your Google account.  You have to have a Google account and G-mail to use this tablet.  That can be done on the tablet during set up.  Set up is fun.  Its says not to charge the tablet until it has a 20% charge before charging the first time. I just  charged it until battery was full. You are supposed to take the keyboard off for set up.  That does not work well when you get to the set up Wi-Fi part. I put the keyboard back on and it was faster and worked fine. The battery charges in about 2 hours after using the tablet. I wanted to download my Norton security that I have with my phone and net service on this tablet.  But this tablet is a android and you can only do that with a tablet with windows.  You can buy more security or another security system for this tablet, if you want to. This tablet does update its security and apps.  Update : I got aCHINFAI Portable Wired USB Keyboard Silicone Silent Waterproof Keyboards for Computer Laptop PC, Pink\xc2\xa0roll up keyboard to use with tablet.  You just plug it into the USB port and it works like a regular keyboard with this tablet.  I am adding a link.']}

Getting the 8gb of RAM combined with the 1 TB Hard Drive and very very nice A12-9720p processor is just unbeatable at $330. This laptop can easily play games like Minecraft, Terraria, and the Binding of Isaac. It can also play games like Borderlands 2, Bioshock, and Star Wars: The Old Republic very well at reduced settings. I got this laptop for my upcoming college semester and I know it'll handle that with ease", b"This laptop is a very powerful machine and a great value for all of the hardware features.Pros:powerful quad core amd 2.7 GHZ 2017 CPU with turbo boost up to 3.6 GHZ8 Gig DDR4 ram, expandable to 16 gig ddr4 ram1 TB hard driveUSB Type-C (future proof your household)2 USB 3.01 HDMIWebcamDVD-RW DriveBluetoothAC wifi (future proof your household)Thin and sturdy constructionRadeon R7 GPUCons:I have read that some folks expected a brighter screenBattery lasts a couple of hours of regular useI researched all of the specifications of this laptop, and I just was not able to get these awesome hardware specs without spending over $500.  I was looking for at least a quad-core cpu, and at least 4 gigs of DDR4 ram.  Usually laptops with 8 gigs of DDR4 ram are well over $500.  Many budget laptops today still have DDR3 ram, and usually have 4 gigs of DDR3 ram.  We might as well future proof our experience with USB Type-C, and AC wifi so our purchase isn't outdated for a couple of years at least.  The 1 Terra-byte hard drive is more than enough space for a lifetime, but is also what is holding this laptop back.  I went ahead and purchased an external HDD enclosure, and a Samsung evo 850 500 GB solid state hard drive.  I transferred my data to the Samsung SSD, installed the SSD into the laptop, and reused the 1 terra-byte HDD which came in the laptop as an external 1 TB drive.  This laptop completely starts and is all ready to be used in aproximately 2-3 seconds after pressing the ON button with the solid state drive.  With the solid state drive, this machine is really comparable to other laptops which cost $800 and above.  I have had my laptop only for about a month, and I love it so far!  I am a student, and I primarily use my laptop for research and homework at school, but I also play some games on it too.  I immediately purchased a soft neoprene case for this laptop, and put the laptop in the neoprene case, which goes into my padded backpack laptop pocket to protect my investment.  This laptop is so powerful with awesome hardware that I thought about purchasing 2 of them because it's a steal.  I'll report back in the future if I run into any issues, but I am extremely happy with my future proof and powerful laptop at this price!", b'UPDATE 1: Yes, the "R7 graphics" on this chip is indeed the 512 GCN shaders version, not the weaker 384 GCN shader version found in the "other" A12. As a quick side-note, Lenovo seems to be one of the few "built to last" brands, I still have an old i3-3110m laptop from like 2012 and it still runs like a champ despite my heavy heavy use (usually had it on 10-14 hours a day) and accidentally dropping it a few times. I\'ve really grown to like this brand over the years (trust).UPDATE 2: 12/11/2017 - It seems to handle the new "Antorus the Burning Throne" raid just fine (with lowered settings, of course), frame-rates are comparable to Tomb of Sargeras from what I saw. I did a few Antorus LFRs last week between my various alts and didn\'t have any issues, A12-9720P is definitely a solid chip for the price. By the way, coming up on 4 months of regular use and still running great. Like I said the only real noticeable issue is the relatively slow 5400 RPM hard drive, which makes loading in take a little longer, but that\'s about it.I\'ll chime in here for my fellow WoW players, recently picked up this VERY solid machine over at Best Buy. One day while randomly browsing their site, I noticed the price suddenly dropped to $320 out of nowhere. Recognizing the bargain, I went and bought it same day.Anyways, it plays WoW: Legion just fine on lowered settings. Since it\'s Labor day weekend and I\'ve been bored, I\'ve really put in some hours and "put it through it\'s paces" the last few days. Here\'s some rough averages of performance at the stock resolution (1366 x 768):15-45 fps... in "new" Dalaran45-80 fps... just flying around Broken Isles/open world35-50 fps... typical average while doing WQ\'s14-23 fps... in "high clutter" scenarios, heavy AoE, lots of players/mobs on screen, etc25-50 fps... in most Bg\'s, a little lower during "high clutter" encounters obviously (ex. in AV/IoC matches)17-25 fps... typical LFR boss or raid scenario25-55 fps... typical 5-man dungeonThe only real "cons" I can think of:- runs a little hot, I ran HWMonitor in the background during my WoW sessions and the CPU did get up to around 65-67C at times, although it MOSTLY hovers around 56-60C from what I\'ve seen (mostly playing WoW, I can\'t speak for other games)- USB ports are located on the left side of the machine, just a minor inconvenience (no biggie)- still uses the older/slower 5400 RPM hard drive, again not a big deal for the low priceFor only $320 I\'m very satisfied with my purchase, this machine is a great value in the sub-$400 laptop segment. Most laptops in this price segment can\'t play games at all, or if they do play games it\'s a slide-show (ex. Intel graphics).', b"I've really enjoyed this product and would've given it a higher rating if it wasn't for a few problems.First, the battery is rather low, having around only 2 hours of active usage.  Secondly, the charger is short, which is a annoying combination with the low battery.  And lastly, my biggest problem is that it tends to restart from time to time for no reason when you use it for longer periods of time.  But the sound system is amazing.  It loads at a good speed, and it works fine besides my problems."]}

These guys represented an 8 or more year old unit, just right. Can't believe the previous reviews read. This is an old laptop that still works. Not to ever compete with currently available systems. Want to surf the web, perfect. Want to use old, outdated software, excellent. Shouldn't beat these people up because it isn't like the latest and greatest. Adjust your expectations to something more realistic given the circumstances.", b'A really fast, good laptop if you want to use windows xp, 8, or linux. I could play all the types of media and have yet to try a blueray video file I have on my other hdd at 1920x1050(?) resolution. I know my duocore desktop lagged and this is just a tiny bit slower but this might be able to (different video card).I could play SC2 on this if I wanted. All emulators worked no problem. It\'s a great laptop and I rarely find myself waiting.With my laptop only...The "a" key was very touchy, a small amount of pressure caused it to type. The USBs on the side easily pushed in slightly (but still work) while I pressed on them to check them. Also the screen I got had a few grouped missing pixels that looks like "ff" but works fine.I almost sent it back but decided to keep it and it has not failed.', b'Refurbished, but look almost like new. These are the best laptops besides the Lenova ThinkPad T400 with the best operating system Windows XP. I upgraded my internal HDD to a 250GB SSD. Upgraded my RAM to 4GB. Fast as lightning laptop! I use mine mainly for entertainment to play screensavers, videos, N64 ROMS, Super NES ROMS, Sega Gen ROMS, NES ROMS, GBA ROMS, Atari 2600 ROMS and PC games. This laptop also has 4 USB ports which can be used hook up PC control pads. Works great with my 55 inch Sanyo LCD TV. When I turn on my Marine Aquarium 3 screensaver people go "WOW!"', b'I bought this laptop directly from dell Financial Services auction on ebay. I did not even know that they have it here on Amazon Marketplace too. Even though the description said manufacturer refurbished the laptop I received looked like new. It came with power adapter and a Dell Windows XP Reinstallation CD and built in Intel PROSet Wireless Card. Absolutely no bloatware is included.Now this may not be a top of the line machine but it is pretty adequate for home and school or even Small Home Office use. The neat part is that once you boot up the machine for the first time it would automatically install Windows XP after going through some preliminary steps. It even gives you option to enter setup and configure things but you are better off leaving the machine alone to do its thing and install windows XP or whichever operating system it is bundled with unless you\'re techie. Once windows finishes installation you can pretty much install anything you want. I have so far installed Open Office, MS Office 2003, Firefox, Chrome, Avast Anti Virus, Trusteer Rapport security Software and many other productivity softwares and the machine boots up and runs smoothly.It does not come with webcam so I installed Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 and Microsoft Lifecam Cinema and either camera runs smoothly even on HD modes. I use Lifecam Cinema more often because it\'s stand is perfect fit for D630 bezel as opposed to the Quickcam Pro 9000\'s stand which tend to wobble.I will advise you buy this laptop directly from Dell either here on Amazon Marketplace or on ebay where it is listed under Dell_Financial_Services. You will likely receive a laptop that will be like new but more importantly you will get 30 days warranty.This laptop is of right price, size and specs: 14" bright LCD, 2GB Ram, 80GB harddisk space and 2GHZ Intel Dual Core processor that is more than adequate for most home, school and or Small Home Office use. It is sturdy and sleek looking too.There is one thing that Dell scrimped on here: the tiny single speaker that is barely audible! I use an external Frisby USB laptop Speakers. I also use headphone when I am on the road. It is worthy to note that this tiny speaker belies a powerful sound card that only becomes apparent when you put on a headphone.NB: Don\'t forget to switch on the wireless radio or you will not be able to use the wifi connection. The switch is on same side and next to the headphone jack. It is switched off by default. Once you switch it on it will detect a bunch of wifi hot spots including yours, if any. Select your SSID from the displayed options and enter your router\'s WEP Key and you will be good to go. I have at&t 2WIRE Wireless Gateway and the WEP Key is the ten digit number directly below the serial number located on the side or bottom of the router depending on whether it is standing vertically or lying on it\'s side. The built in wireless card is powerful. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who may be on budget but not willing to compromise on quality and performance.', b"this laptop is amazing for business uses and shopping only. i didn't mind the scratches on the surface because some of them aren't noticeable. the battery doesn't last long, so i upgraded it myself with a 9 hour cell battery. you can't use this for gaming because low resolution (32 bit), need to upgrade to windows 7 and low video card. definitely you should buy this if you're using this for business otherwise look else where.", b"(If I have a problem I will update this review at that time, but suspect I will not.)  All I wanted is something to use offline, a graphics art program.  I do not want to be online with this laptop - I use a desktop for that - because I don't want to worry about viruses or hackers etc.  messing with my art projects.  Therefore I can't comment on how it works online.The program, Painter X  (X stands for 10, not X rated!), works just as fast and well as it does on my brand new Dell laptop. Ditto Windows XP.  I don't know about the battery since I plan to pretty much leave it in the same spot and keep it plugged in.  Everything looks virtually new.  Also, the person at Incomputer was very swift to answer my little Qs and help me out regarding a problem with the Painter (easily resolved since he knew what to do) Program.  Thanks Incomputer!", b'This unit was purchased for my son. I was disappointed when it arrived as it turned out to be a D620 rather than the one advertised. I did not make an issue since the unit was adequate for the purpose. It was refurbished, as advertised, and the battery needed immediate replacement. All-in-all the purchased unit has functioned adequately, but I would not buy from this vendor again due to the different unit being shipped.']}

Ill break the review down into 2 parts. Ill start first with the hardware which should be helpful to anyone reading this and then the second part will specifically be about using Linux on it. Model is Dell i5379-5893GRY-PUS (Dell Inspiron 13" 2-in-1 touchscreen)Hardware:The build quality is nice. Despite being a plastic shell (instead of metal like the Inspiron 7000) it feels of good quality to the point of questioning if it is plastic. The finish is nice and doesn\'t appear to attract finger prints as much as glossier finishes. Its a good balance of enough weight to not feel cheap but not too much that its "heavy" for its size.Specs:* Intel i5-8250U (8th gen i5 with 4c/8t @ 15watt TDP)* Intel UHD Graphics 620 (integrated graphics, no dedicated GPU)* 8GB DDR4 2400mhz RAM (I think 1x8GB, will have to verify)* 256GB SATA SSD (Samsung PM871 from what I can tell, seems to be 2.5" 7mm not m.2)* 13" 1920x1080 IPS touchscreen (glossy, but not terrible)* Webcam supports Windows HelloPorts:2x USB 3.1 type-A1x USB 2.0 type-A1x HDMI (listed as 1.4)1x SD card reader1x Headphone/mic combo jackThe monitor has, in my opinion, pretty large bezels. At first I was disappointed by this but considering its ability to take a tablet form, this likely was done to give something to hold onto in tablet mode without touching the screen by accident. Otherwise its sharp and bright with decent viewing angles.The rear of the base has a short, somewhat wide vent to exhaust hot air out and does have an active fan however at its loudest it was negligible. I would have to focus on trying to hear it to notice. The upside is it should allow longer boost times on the CPU before throttling sets in.I found it a bit strange at first that the power and volume rocker are on the right side towards the front of the machine, but have since gotten used to it and figure it is also likely purposeful due to being able to use it like a tablet.The hinge between the base and monitor is sturdy and feels like it should last if treated well. I dont notice any wobbling while typing on a hard flat surface. The keyboard is ok but not great. I like the look of it and the backlighting can be plenty bright but the feel leaves a bit to be desired. The key presses seem to allow for pressure un-evenly on a key allowing one side to press further than the others which gives the sense that its not that sturdy. I would expect for the press to evenly push the key down but on this keyboard its a bit "mushy". For what its worth it appears to be the exact same keyboard as the Inspiron 13" 7000 series. On the flip side, the touch pad is pretty nice and I typically hate touchpads. This one is pretty large and the buttons (bottom right and left of the touchpad itself) are clicky.It doesnt look like there are any bay doors on the bottom to access the SSD or RAM and the batter is a built in job, not easily replaceable (if at all). It is unclear if the laptop has the 8GB included soldered in or in 1 of 2 ram slots. Its also unclear, but I expect that there is an empty 2nd ram slot (as most documentation seems to indicate it can be upgraded to 16GB by the user, just not how). I would imagine this would require removing the 8 or so screws on the bottom and maybe even using a pry tool to unsnap some plastic fasteners are the edges.For the price I was unable to find a laptop with everything I was looking to compete with this. I wanted a 13" or smaller 1080 touchscreen with an 8th gen CPU, 250GB+ SSD, 8GB+ DDR4 RAM. This was the best deal I could find at the time including that ($709). There are tradeoffs with that. Some of what you dont get are:* USB type-c* Thunderbolt 3* NVMe PCIe SSD* Metal body* Higher resolution screenI would say this is a great machine for anyone who wants something small and portable with decent specs and that doesnt require a ton of storage or super demanding tasks (CAD, 3d rendering, advanced photoshop, extrmely large databases/spreadsheets, etc.) or gaming.Linux:I am now using Linux at work alot and learn best by giving myself a practical purpose to do something. I wanted to entrench myself in Linux at home while having something that was modern, aesthetically pleasing, functional, practical and portable.Prior to getting this laptop I tried about about 10+ distros and decided that; a) I liked KDE Plasma as a desktop environment best and b) I like Manjaro Linux as a distro the most.I didnt get this to do development type work from or anything like that. This is meant to be my "daily driver", its what I will use every day to browse the web, check email, work on documents, watch media, do some minor photo/video editing, occasionally run a VM, etc.I downloaded the 17.0.6 Manjaro KDE ISO and setup an USB3 drive to install from. Booted from the drive and ran installer which took about 5-10 mins which is on par or maybe slightly faster than I would expect for a Win 10 install using the same hardware/specs.Out of the box all of the drivers where recognized and working. Here are a couple things I was worried about and can confirm all working:* Qualcomm AC Wifi (will add model later, not handy right now).* Qualcomm Bluetooth* Touchscreen* Keyboard Backlight* Webcam (both standard and infrared lol)* GPU drivers for Intel* Screen Brightness* SoundI have not yet found any part of the hardware not working as intended.Battery life appears to land me at about 6+ hours of steady use so I am very happy with it.Software wise, most things just work. I have had to, as with any linux distro, troubleshoot and work out some kinks but nothing I can even recall as worth mentioning.At the end of the day, this is the first time I have felt like I really own the computer. KDE especially allows a level of customization I could only dream of in Windows. This is coming from someone who not only likes Windows 10, but previously worked for a company for 6 years with MS partnership in which we provided remote and on site support for many of their products including Windows and Office. I\'ve developed professional course material and classes on Windows and taught the classes. I have defended Windows 10 fiercely at times. I have Windows Server 2016 Essentials at home and 3 other Windows 10 Pro computers on the domain with it.Why say all this about Windows? If someone like me can escape MS\'s strangle hold so can you. If you have considered moving to Linux this laptop is a great choice. However, dont take my word for it. Do your research, decide what distro and make sure it will work with whatever you install it on.EDIT (11/20/2017): So it appears the RAM and SSD can be upgraded. To do so requires removing the bottom of the laptop (roughly 8-10 screws and using a pry tool to unhinge the plastic tabs). Crucial shows upto 32GB (2x 16GB) RAM and guarantees compatibility. The SSD is a 2.5" SATA SSD 7mm height, so m.2 drives will NOT work and especially not PCIe/NVMe drives. I havent upgraded myself as I have no need to now.EDIT (01/02/2018): For anyone concerned with firmware/BIOS updates while using Linux I have done a Intel ME Firmware update and a BIOS update (1.3.2).For the Intel SA-00086 advisory and update Dell has a page listing all model affected with links to their updates (a link to it is posted on Intel\'s official page for the advisory). In this case I used a Windows to Go drive to boot to Windows 10 without altering the installed setup on my machine. I had to install drivers to Intels ME and reboot. I then ran the update from Windows to Go and then shutdown and booted back to Manjaro KDE to verify the results via the script Intel provides and it returned that the issue was patched. Be aware booting from Windows to Go wouldnt be needed if running Windows already.The BIOS is actually easier. You just put the BIOS update exe on a thumb drive and plug it in, boot and press F12 to get the boot menu, select BIOS update. Browse to the update file on the thumb drive and run the update. I havent seen any other firmware udpates related to the laptop but if there are others I will likely use a Windows to go drive to do so unless its specifically a BIOS update.**Upgraded machine!!!I have since purchase changed the wifi card and upgraded the RAM. I did this as the QCA6174 wifi card made by Qualcomm isnt exactly Linux friendly. It worked, but had 2 major issues. Slow SMB xfer and it would report wifi connecting at 6 MiB/s (incorrectly). I bought an Intel 8265 which is officially supported for use in Linux brand new for $20 and works perfectly.I figured while I had it open to add another stick of RAM so I bought an 8GB stick of crucial RAM\xc2\xa0Crucial 8GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) DR x8 Unbuffered SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD824A\xc2\xa0and it worked perfectly. To be honest the RAM upgrade wasnt even needed, but didnt want to break it open just to change the wifi card out. I considered an SSD upgrade as well, but I have like 200GB free of the 256GB so I am not exactly hurting for space.Also using this bluetooth mouse\xc2\xa0Logitech MX Anywhere 2 Wireless Mobile Mouse, Long Range Wireless Mouse with Hyper Scroll and Easy-Switch up to 3 Devices - Navy\xc2\xa0which plays very nicely connected via bluetooth. Latest stable Manjaro update even adds its battery status to the battery notification area! Really like this mouse.Would still highly recommend this laptop as I am sure it will serve me for years to come.', b'I like the laptop. Light wt, touch screen is excellent with good resolution, super quiet, SDD is amazing ( first time owning one). Fast enough with me running photoshop 2017. Overall good laptopCONS :- plastic build, could have been more sturdy- camera is ok ok. although tbh, no one really uses it these days- fan vent is located facing down, cant keep on the bed or on lap.', b'Light, feels sturdy. great screen. Has been a wonderful laptop so far. I spent a little more to get the solid state drive instead of a traditional disk. Less storage, but as one reviewer pointed out much lighter.', b"I'll be honest in saying I'm pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect to love this laptop as much as I did. After my tablet finally died I wanted something more versatile, and was thinking detachable keyboards would be the way to go. Saw this for the right price and decided to give it a shot. I'll never buy a 2-in-1 that can't swivel, ever. Can rotate it to any angle, adapts right away to tablet mode. It's a solid little powerhouse that can get a bit hot, but that's expected. Low storage isn't a huge issue. You can keep most things on another homegroup computer and keep the essentials local. Overall, great laptop for the price", b"I bought this laptop in December'17. My laptop started having issues a very few months after purchase (its still in warranty for quite some time). The laptop kept powering off and then not starting back-on (or no display) despite several tries and showed random behavior (i had to reset the OS too, losing all my data). Ultimately there came a time when the laptop shut off with no LEDs turning on and the laptop would not power-on no matter what. I had to FedEX ship my product to their Houston site after making a long customer delivery call. I got back my laptop in a week (with the motherboard replaced). However, ever since, it has battery issues (ie. the battery drops from 50%+ to 6% within a minute) making it impossible to work with the laptop unless connected to a power source. I have never seen a Dell laptop to have misbehaved so much, it really hinders all your work.", b"I bought this to replace a Dell XPS 13 that died suddenly.  While it doesn't have the fancy aluminum case, thin bezel and carbon fiber hand rest of the XPS, this Inspiron has a newer 8th generation processor, twice the SSD space, a touch screen and nice form flexibility.  I got it all set up and have found that it has a good looking screen, reasonably fast performance for a laptop and I like the ability to use it as a laptop or as a tablet.The performance and strong features for a price point of just $650, make this a very attractive choice if you are looking for a laptop of this size.", b'I absolutely love this product. It is light, and ideal for traveling with. Has a SSD with more than adequate storage for my needs, more than enough RAM, more than enough CPU speed/performance for everything I do. Battery life is ~ 7h. The network connectivity chip of this PC is a welcome change from my last PC (an HP which struggled with connecting to Wifi). This laptop immediately locks in to the nearest WiFi extender in my home - or any other WiFi I connect it to. LOVE the back-lit keyboard (my MUST-HAVE feature). Just the perfect PC for me. Very happy - No hesitation recommending this product.', b'Love this fast light weight computer. I use Corel draw on it and heavy duty embroidery software. Fast and easy']}

I went ahead and checked the internals as well, (not for your average home user), and it was very clean. My particular unit was manufactured in May of 2012, and I am thinking it did not have a lot of mileage to it. It does come with a new clean installation of Windows 7 64 bit Professional, ready to boot up and install. The battery seemed in good shape, and passed the Dell website battery diagnostic test. In addition, while these machines are out of original warranty, (3 years), the Dell website is full of easy to use support options, even offering an extended warranty if you wish to pay for it. A machine like this, refurbished from Dell proper, will run $700 to $800. You might want to read the reviews on the Dell E6420 on the Web, as it is a robust laptop, made for travel and not made of egg shells. Fantastic machine.On the critical side, my unit came with the i5-2410M Intel Sandy Bridge processor, and not the i5-2520, (as advertised), and the i5-2410M is slightly slower, with a base of 2.3 Ghz., and turbo boost (sustained) of 2.8 Ghz. In addition, the 4 GB of RAM, (2 x 2 GB modules), were miss matched in speed, so they were only running at 533 Mhz, and not 667 Mhz. I went ahead and changed them out to new 2 new Corsair RAM modules at 4 GB, for a total of 8 GB dual channel memory, now running at 800 Mhz. I was not crazy about the old Samsung 128 GB SSD that came with the Laptop, so I changed it out to a new Toshiba 256 GB Q Series Pro SSD, and I ran an additional clean install of Windows 7 64 bit Professional. The new RAM and new SSD made a reasonably fast laptop even faster. You can use this laptop for very demanding applications without the computer lagging or slowing down. The only area this laptop might fall short on would be for intensive graphics associated with complex PC games, 3D rendering, or intense video editing. For most business and home applications, this laptop will more then keep up.Keep in mind, that if you need any additional drivers or support, you can get it all at the Dell website. I went ahead and updated the BIOS and  checked for the most up to date drivers off of the Dell website.Also, be prepared to take some time on the first install of Windows 7, that there will be about 200 to 220 updates needed almost immediately once you get the machine up and running and hooked up to the Internet. On the bright side, you did not get a new laptop with a "ton" of stupid bloatware and junk you did not want or need.These Dell Machines do come in slightly different configurations, and are being sold by different secondary vendors. Mine came from TechHarvard, but there are 2 or 3 other vendors selling these as well under this same heading. While I feel very positive about buying this refurbished laptop, and I know I got an excellent value, individual results may vary.Quite frankly, I would buy this machine again, and I would buy this refurbished Dell laptop ahead of most of the new junk that you can find in the Retail stores. If you are on a budget, and you need a great laptop, you could not go wrong buying this unit. If you are not on a budget, go ahead and get the new Dell E6440 laptop, but be prepared to fork over $1,200 or so for the privilege. Trust me, the Dell E6440 is not going to perform much better then this refurbished E6420, and if the new E6440 comes with a standard hard drive instead of an SSD, it will be a slower machine.If in doubt, just buy it.(Edit and Update Jan 2017). I did go ahead and upgrade this Laptop PC to Windows 10 Pro, during the Summer of 2016. I am happy to share that I ran into "Zero" issues with the upgrade, and had no driver issues. Even at this particular time of update, a year and a half after I have purchased this machine, it is still running strong and it is a better value than the Laptops you might get at a Big Box Store. FYI.', b"Excellent Laptop !! As my current laptop stopped working, I have been looking for a replacement. With the help of my IT friends i understood that Dell Latitude 64xx series is a work horse. Very powerful machine. Little skeptical as this is my first refurbished product in any category. But this company didn't disappoint me. They had sent clear notes on how to boot the machine and register. David even sent an email asking if i need any help. I got 6430 even though amazon description says 6420. Very decent configuration. Hard Drive size is less but you cant ask more in $200 laptop. It comes with 1 year warranty, which is a big plus. Booting is very fast as the hard disk is SSD. Able to setup easily and the laptop was up and running in no time. Overall, i believe this is a very good buy and value for money. Hope Blazing Prices could support if there are any issues. Its been 1 week and the review is based on that. I will come back and write more after few months.", b'Certainly meets my expectations as a refurbished computer. I would say it is much closer to "New". Not a single wear mark on the machine anywhere. Performance is more than adequate, and the solid state hard drive is absolutely a huge win for performance. I will be installing an additional 4GB of ram into mine although it performs perfectly with the 4 already installed.Rigged design, feels solid and runs as many applications as I need to at any given point in time.', b"The unit I received was sold by Blazing Prices, and refurbished by Joysystems. Without hesitation, I can say that this is the best value (and quite possibly best performing) notebook I've owned (a MacBook Air among them). With the SSD, this boots into the Windows 10 sign-on screen in 6 seconds (from power off), and just a few more seconds to a fully ready desktop after login. Cosmetically, though not in brand new condition, it's in extremely good condition. The only places where there are a few minor scratches, are spots you'll never see. Two thumbs up to Joysystems for the refurbishing job, and Blazing Prices for the good deal.", b"For the price, this is an awesome deal. My refurbished laptop arrived looking and running like brand new. In fact, It's considerably faster than the $800 laptop it replaced. It's missing a couple of features than would have been nice (side numbers and a webcam) but the webcam is pretty much a luxury anyway, and I have one on another laptop. The reason I bought this was that I had previously bought one for my daughter to start college with, and I was so impressed with that one that I purchased a second one. It's a workhorse of a computer and takes all that I can throw at is as a web developer and graphic designer. In fact, I'm sick that I spent $1250 on a new Toshiba back in January when this one performs just as well. I noticed that some other reviews stated problems with some sellers and units that came in with different specs than advertised. I was lucky in that mine's exactly as advertised. Providing you don't have those problems, I can't recommend this laptop highly enough.Dell Latitude E6420 Premium-Built 14.1-Inch Business Laptop (Intel Core i5 2.5GHz with 3.2G Turbo Frequency, 4G RAM, 128G SSD, Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, Certified Refurbished)"]}

It works great and never any question if I will have problems with it. The battery life isn't spectacular but you get what you pay for.", b'I bought this laptop for school. THERE IS NO BATTERY IN THE LAPTOP. IT ONLY WORKS IF ITS PLUGGED UP TO THE CHARGER. Description says it has a 3 lithium battery or whatever it\xe2\x80\x99s called. If I could give this zero stars I would.', b'The Windows 10 will not load the upgrades for security.  It takes over 30 minutes to recycle the startup routineand regain control of the computer.  The batter has never held a charge for more than a couple hours.  Fullycharged and sitting, the battery will drain to 0%.  When this happens the start up cycle can take up to an hourto get to a functional desktop.  Never buy a "certified refurbished" computer from this vender.', b"This is a refurbished laptop. Cosmetically, it's perfect.  However, my problem is with the Windows 10 operating system. It is so junked up that this laptop is MUCH, MUCH slower than my VERY old laptop with a 1.5 GHz Celeron processor and half as much RAM.  I think I am going to have to format the hard drive and install a CLEAN copy of Windows.  Nice hardware, lots of software problems.  Also, if you want disks to restore your OS, there is a piece of paper in the box that just says make your own (no instructions, figure it out yourself). Same with the user's manual."]}

I am not sure why they are selling this instead of the US variant. However, that is what Asus told me. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed any difference between this and the US version, so I do not see any issue with buying this instead.Short Review: This device is a solid machine. It fits a powerful and capable amount of hardware, in a clean and slim design. The screen suffers from bad viewing angles and subpar colors, but is still good enough for most tasks. Overall, this device is quite the bargain when you consider the form factor, performance, and features you are getting for the price.Full Detail Review:- The CPU(i7-7700HQ) is great. It can do pretty much anything you want it to. I am not particularly heavy on computers, but I tested a little bit of After Effects on here and the device handled it very easily. Chrome is no issue when bundled with the 16GB of RAM on this machine. The i7-7700HQ is about as good as you are going to get in a laptop right now, so you really can\'t complain in terms of CPU performance.- The integrated GPU is solid. The GTX 1050 can handle just about any game you throw at it, given it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a AAA title from this year. Overwatch runs at 60FPS on medium graphics. Dirt 3 runs at 110 FPS on ultra-graphics, and Civ 5/6 have no issues running on this device. If the GPU power is a concern for you, go check out some reviews on YouTube about the GTX 1050, that will be able to give you a full rundown on this GPU. Note: It also has Integrated Intel HD 630 Graphics, those are solid too, but irrelevant to the main graphics performance.- Cooling is not an issue under normal performance. It runs completely cool and quiet when performing simple tasks or just browsing Chrome. When gaming, the device really heats up and the fans get rather loud. It gets very hot, seeing temperatures push into 150 degrees Fahrenheit. I absolutely advise against gaming on a bed with this, this is a flat surface gaming machine, hands down. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that would comfortably rest on your lap. This laptop is a tabletop gaming machine but if you are just writing a paper or browsing chrome, it\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable in your laptop or wherever you can safely use it. However, my device did have an issue with one of the fans after just about a week of use. The left fan was working at Max load, while the right wouldn\'t spin up at all. This resulted in a machine that got hotter than I could touch. I attempted to contact Asus about my issues but their Support is a nightmare and reaching someone who can actually help you diagnose the problem, is a rare occurrence.- The SSD(250GB) is fantastic! Boot times are insane! Average boot time from being completely off is about 5-7 seconds. I loaded all my core programs to the SSD and left the 1TB HDD to be the data drive. So far it has been a perfect combination. Everything performs just great! Storage isn\'t an issue and with the SSD, the speed is amazing.- The main thing that brought me to this machine is that it isn\'t coated in ugly red RGB lighting and "gamer" aesthetics. The device is clean. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to compare this design to a MacBook(Minus the full aluminum uni-body, I will talk about this later). You can walk into your office with this thing and still look professional. It does a good job of packing a lot of power into a relatively small body.- According to Asus, the device has an all-aluminum body. I can confirm that the device is in fact Aluminum, but has an odd feel to it. It is almost like they painted the metal with plastic. The device does not feel like a MacBook or Zenbook. It feels sturdy and good, but it leaves you wanting that raw metal touch. It does have that chilled metal feel to it, so it is obviously metal. However, I do know that the bottom of this device is plastic, it doesn\'t get cool like the rest of the device, doesn\'t feel the same, and just looks like plastic. This was obviously either a cost saving or performance related cut that Asus took to keep this device in a more affordable category. Rest assured however, it doesn\'t really take away from the overall feel off the device. When interacting with the laptop you are always in contact with metal and it feels really nice.- The trackpad is in a good place for me. It is out of the way when typing and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mistakenly hit it. This is subjective to how each person uses the device, but in my experience, I have no complaints with the placement of the trackpad. The trackpad also performs fine for me. It has some weird gestures that I am not sure how I keep activating, but as far as usability, it is good. The buttons are clicky and tactile, however, I have an issue sometime moving the cursor while trying to click. I am just not used to this kind of trackpad.-The keyboard is good. It has reasonable travel and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t experienced any major flexing in the keyboard. The backlight works well and it has 3 brightness options. The numpad is weird and kind of feels out of place. I would prefer if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t added one on this model, because it just feels so squished and incomplete. However if a trackpad is desired, this model features one, albeit a small one.- The sound on this laptop is good. It has two speakers on the bottom of the device. They can get muffled a little if you use this on your lap, but on a flat surface, they really perform well. They get much louder than anything I have ever owned and hit the high tones well. Bass is decent, it gets deeper than most laptops in this form factor but I can\xe2\x80\x99t expect a lot from something this size either. Some people have complained about speakers distrorting after going over a certain volume. I haven\'t really experienced this and it may be because I use the included Software utility to choose sound modes. This tool is what Asus claims, will make the device loud without distortion. So perhaps not using this tool could be the issue, but I cannot confirm this.- The screen is the what made this device lose a star from me. It\xe2\x80\x99s a FHD(1920x1080) TN panel. The viewing angles are quite awful and colors look slightly washed out when looking horizontally or vertically at an angle. The screen is a matte material, so reflections aren\xe2\x80\x99t a problem. Seeing as how I paid $1000 for this laptop, I expect a premium display and an IPS display would help a lot. (This laptop is still one of the best for the buck on Amazon though) I also have two small areas on my screen with pixels that are not working right. It\xe2\x80\x99s a small issue that causes a small area to look slightly brighter and kind of washed out. I am going to see if Asus will replace/repair the device, because it can get annoying.- Battery life is not the best, but is about what you would expect on a device with a high-performance CPU and GPU. I get about 4-5 hours of battery life when doing basic and simple tasks. However, I only get about 1-2 hours when playing high intensity games. It is important to note that it charges very fast. I have not gotten a complete measurement, but it charges faster than other laptops I have owned.- The network card on this laptop is great. It has good connectivity and achieves the max speeds of my network. I have no complaints about the network card.*Shipping Issue* This device arrived in a box that was much bigger than it should have been. The box was easily twice the size that it needed to be and there was no protection inside the box. There was literally a laptop box inside a much bigger shipping box (see picture), nothing to pad it or protect it. I hope Amazon fixes this issue because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all safe to ship this device like that. My screen has a small issue that might have been cause by this shipping issue. NOTE: I contacted Amazon about my complaints with the packaging and they offered me a generous compensation or replacement, whichever I chose. The shipping issue will hopefully be resolved soon.Disclaimer: I returned this product. I was having an issue with one of the fans not working. I attempted to contact Asus. To say the least, their support is garbage! I contacted them via chat, phone, and twitter. Everytime I was met with long delays or disconnects. I couldn\'t speak to someone who could help me, often times even getting someone  who seemed like they didn\'t even know Asus made laptops. Eventually Asus\'s Twitter got back to me, but they insisted that I just send it in. They offered no diagnostic. I needed this machine and I at least needed to know what was wrong and how long it would take, they offered no answers and said that was all they could do. With that in mind I started a refund with Amazon. This laptop is really good if it fits your needs and isn\'t broken. However once you do have an issue with the hardware, you enter into a support Hell. I really hope Asus fixes their support. For now I am going to check out the XPS 15.', b"I purchased this laptop to replace my 2016 Acer swift 3 ultrabook class laptop. I got this laptop because it offers far more performance and upgrade paths than my previously laptop.So far here's what I likeThe boot time is very fast takes a few seconds.The keyboard is great, there is no flex and typing feels great. The keyboard back lighting gets sufficiently bright and allows for 3 brightness toggles.The internals of this laptop allows for a lot of upgrades. I purchased the i5 model and the after opening the laptop I found an empty hard drive bay and an empty ram slot. The screen can also be upgraded if you don't like the TN panel. I plan on upgrading my screen to IPS in a few days since it seems like a fairly easy process.Also this laptop is great for gaming. Since the screen has such a high ppi you can pretty much leave off AA and get 60 fps on high settings on all games. Even demanding games like battlefield 1 run great.Fan noise while gaming isn't too loud and the laptop doesn't feel hot. Having the extra air intakes on the bottom of the laptop helps a lot with thermals.The screen also gets pretty bright. You won't have any annoying screen reflections when using indoors and is even fine for some outdoor usage.Here's what I don't like about this laptopThe track pad definitely has some issues. Out of the box I couldn't use two finger scrolling since it kept getting confused with the pinch to zoom gesture. So I had to disable pinch to zoom entirely. Now it works about most of the time but not 100%. Also sometimes when I'm using the track pad it'll just stop responding to my finger an the mouse cursor will stay in place. This is pretty annoying and happens a lot more than it should. Also to top it off the track pad just feels really plasticity and cheap.The screen is a TN panel so the colors look pretty dull and the vertical viewing angles are horrible. However the viewing angles from the side are almost as good as IPS.Overall I'm pleased with this laptop and would recommend it if you looking for a thin and light gaming laptop. However this laptop isn't perfect out of the box, you gotta be willing to take it apart and upgrade it to get the best experience."]}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

Nothing but problems. Will not do updates and will not shut down.  Save your money and do not buy.', b"My rating doesn't have to do with the refurbish job, but with the quality of the laptop. This thing is not compatible with Windows 10. It can't even turn off without holding down the power button, as the Windows shutdown option just takes you to the log in screen as if you chose to log out. I plan to get Windows 7 asap tho replace Windows 10.", b"For anyone who is completely satisfied with Windows 7, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal.  Since it is a 'certified refurbished' machine is comes with only the basic Windows software so you will have to install your virus protection (I used Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Security Essentials) and spend some time with the many (automatic) updates necessary to bring the software up to date. But, not having to remove all the pre-installed bloat-ware that usually comes with a new machine is well worth the time. The machine starts quickly, has a bright screen with plenty of speed for normal web browsing & video streaming, has a DVD RW drive and 3-USB & 1-HDMI port and a 230GB hard drive.", b'One I received the computer and booted it up I kept getting this error', b"Bought this laptop to completely wipe and put Linux on. It works great and never any question if I will have problems with it. The battery life isn't spectacular but you get what you pay for.", b'I bought this laptop for school. THERE IS NO BATTERY IN THE LAPTOP. IT ONLY WORKS IF ITS PLUGGED UP TO THE CHARGER. Description says it has a 3 lithium battery or whatever it\xe2\x80\x99s called. If I could give this zero stars I would.', b'The Windows 10 will not load the upgrades for security.  It takes over 30 minutes to recycle the startup routineand regain control of the computer.  The batter has never held a charge for more than a couple hours.  Fullycharged and sitting, the battery will drain to 0%.  When this happens the start up cycle can take up to an hourto get to a functional desktop.  Never buy a "certified refurbished" computer from this vender.', b"This is a refurbished laptop. Cosmetically, it's perfect.  However, my problem is with the Windows 10 operating system. It is so junked up that this laptop is MUCH, MUCH slower than my VERY old laptop with a 1.5 GHz Celeron processor and half as much RAM.  I think I am going to have to format the hard drive and install a CLEAN copy of Windows.  Nice hardware, lots of software problems.  Also, if you want disks to restore your OS, there is a piece of paper in the box that just says make your own (no instructions, figure it out yourself). Same with the user's manual."]}

I am not sure why they are selling this instead of the US variant. However, that is what Asus told me. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed any difference between this and the US version, so I do not see any issue with buying this instead.Short Review: This device is a solid machine. It fits a powerful and capable amount of hardware, in a clean and slim design. The screen suffers from bad viewing angles and subpar colors, but is still good enough for most tasks. Overall, this device is quite the bargain when you consider the form factor, performance, and features you are getting for the price.Full Detail Review:- The CPU(i7-7700HQ) is great. It can do pretty much anything you want it to. I am not particularly heavy on computers, but I tested a little bit of After Effects on here and the device handled it very easily. Chrome is no issue when bundled with the 16GB of RAM on this machine. The i7-7700HQ is about as good as you are going to get in a laptop right now, so you really can\'t complain in terms of CPU performance.- The integrated GPU is solid. The GTX 1050 can handle just about any game you throw at it, given it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a AAA title from this year. Overwatch runs at 60FPS on medium graphics. Dirt 3 runs at 110 FPS on ultra-graphics, and Civ 5/6 have no issues running on this device. If the GPU power is a concern for you, go check out some reviews on YouTube about the GTX 1050, that will be able to give you a full rundown on this GPU. Note: It also has Integrated Intel HD 630 Graphics, those are solid too, but irrelevant to the main graphics performance.- Cooling is not an issue under normal performance. It runs completely cool and quiet when performing simple tasks or just browsing Chrome. When gaming, the device really heats up and the fans get rather loud. It gets very hot, seeing temperatures push into 150 degrees Fahrenheit. I absolutely advise against gaming on a bed with this, this is a flat surface gaming machine, hands down. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that would comfortably rest on your lap. This laptop is a tabletop gaming machine but if you are just writing a paper or browsing chrome, it\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable in your laptop or wherever you can safely use it. However, my device did have an issue with one of the fans after just about a week of use. The left fan was working at Max load, while the right wouldn\'t spin up at all. This resulted in a machine that got hotter than I could touch. I attempted to contact Asus about my issues but their Support is a nightmare and reaching someone who can actually help you diagnose the problem, is a rare occurrence.- The SSD(250GB) is fantastic! Boot times are insane! Average boot time from being completely off is about 5-7 seconds. I loaded all my core programs to the SSD and left the 1TB HDD to be the data drive. So far it has been a perfect combination. Everything performs just great! Storage isn\'t an issue and with the SSD, the speed is amazing.- The main thing that brought me to this machine is that it isn\'t coated in ugly red RGB lighting and "gamer" aesthetics. The device is clean. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to compare this design to a MacBook(Minus the full aluminum uni-body, I will talk about this later). You can walk into your office with this thing and still look professional. It does a good job of packing a lot of power into a relatively small body.- According to Asus, the device has an all-aluminum body. I can confirm that the device is in fact Aluminum, but has an odd feel to it. It is almost like they painted the metal with plastic. The device does not feel like a MacBook or Zenbook. It feels sturdy and good, but it leaves you wanting that raw metal touch. It does have that chilled metal feel to it, so it is obviously metal. However, I do know that the bottom of this device is plastic, it doesn\'t get cool like the rest of the device, doesn\'t feel the same, and just looks like plastic. This was obviously either a cost saving or performance related cut that Asus took to keep this device in a more affordable category. Rest assured however, it doesn\'t really take away from the overall feel off the device. When interacting with the laptop you are always in contact with metal and it feels really nice.- The trackpad is in a good place for me. It is out of the way when typing and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mistakenly hit it. This is subjective to how each person uses the device, but in my experience, I have no complaints with the placement of the trackpad. The trackpad also performs fine for me. It has some weird gestures that I am not sure how I keep activating, but as far as usability, it is good. The buttons are clicky and tactile, however, I have an issue sometime moving the cursor while trying to click. I am just not used to this kind of trackpad.-The keyboard is good. It has reasonable travel and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t experienced any major flexing in the keyboard. The backlight works well and it has 3 brightness options. The numpad is weird and kind of feels out of place. I would prefer if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t added one on this model, because it just feels so squished and incomplete. However if a trackpad is desired, this model features one, albeit a small one.- The sound on this laptop is good. It has two speakers on the bottom of the device. They can get muffled a little if you use this on your lap, but on a flat surface, they really perform well. They get much louder than anything I have ever owned and hit the high tones well. Bass is decent, it gets deeper than most laptops in this form factor but I can\xe2\x80\x99t expect a lot from something this size either. Some people have complained about speakers distrorting after going over a certain volume. I haven\'t really experienced this and it may be because I use the included Software utility to choose sound modes. This tool is what Asus claims, will make the device loud without distortion. So perhaps not using this tool could be the issue, but I cannot confirm this.- The screen is the what made this device lose a star from me. It\xe2\x80\x99s a FHD(1920x1080) TN panel. The viewing angles are quite awful and colors look slightly washed out when looking horizontally or vertically at an angle. The screen is a matte material, so reflections aren\xe2\x80\x99t a problem. Seeing as how I paid $1000 for this laptop, I expect a premium display and an IPS display would help a lot. (This laptop is still one of the best for the buck on Amazon though) I also have two small areas on my screen with pixels that are not working right. It\xe2\x80\x99s a small issue that causes a small area to look slightly brighter and kind of washed out. I am going to see if Asus will replace/repair the device, because it can get annoying.- Battery life is not the best, but is about what you would expect on a device with a high-performance CPU and GPU. I get about 4-5 hours of battery life when doing basic and simple tasks. However, I only get about 1-2 hours when playing high intensity games. It is important to note that it charges very fast. I have not gotten a complete measurement, but it charges faster than other laptops I have owned.- The network card on this laptop is great. It has good connectivity and achieves the max speeds of my network. I have no complaints about the network card.*Shipping Issue* This device arrived in a box that was much bigger than it should have been. The box was easily twice the size that it needed to be and there was no protection inside the box. There was literally a laptop box inside a much bigger shipping box (see picture), nothing to pad it or protect it. I hope Amazon fixes this issue because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all safe to ship this device like that. My screen has a small issue that might have been cause by this shipping issue. NOTE: I contacted Amazon about my complaints with the packaging and they offered me a generous compensation or replacement, whichever I chose. The shipping issue will hopefully be resolved soon.Disclaimer: I returned this product. I was having an issue with one of the fans not working. I attempted to contact Asus. To say the least, their support is garbage! I contacted them via chat, phone, and twitter. Everytime I was met with long delays or disconnects. I couldn\'t speak to someone who could help me, often times even getting someone  who seemed like they didn\'t even know Asus made laptops. Eventually Asus\'s Twitter got back to me, but they insisted that I just send it in. They offered no diagnostic. I needed this machine and I at least needed to know what was wrong and how long it would take, they offered no answers and said that was all they could do. With that in mind I started a refund with Amazon. This laptop is really good if it fits your needs and isn\'t broken. However once you do have an issue with the hardware, you enter into a support Hell. I really hope Asus fixes their support. For now I am going to check out the XPS 15.', b"I purchased this laptop to replace my 2016 Acer swift 3 ultrabook class laptop. I got this laptop because it offers far more performance and upgrade paths than my previously laptop.So far here's what I likeThe boot time is very fast takes a few seconds.The keyboard is great, there is no flex and typing feels great. The keyboard back lighting gets sufficiently bright and allows for 3 brightness toggles.The internals of this laptop allows for a lot of upgrades. I purchased the i5 model and the after opening the laptop I found an empty hard drive bay and an empty ram slot. The screen can also be upgraded if you don't like the TN panel. I plan on upgrading my screen to IPS in a few days since it seems like a fairly easy process.Also this laptop is great for gaming. Since the screen has such a high ppi you can pretty much leave off AA and get 60 fps on high settings on all games. Even demanding games like battlefield 1 run great.Fan noise while gaming isn't too loud and the laptop doesn't feel hot. Having the extra air intakes on the bottom of the laptop helps a lot with thermals.The screen also gets pretty bright. You won't have any annoying screen reflections when using indoors and is even fine for some outdoor usage.Here's what I don't like about this laptopThe track pad definitely has some issues. Out of the box I couldn't use two finger scrolling since it kept getting confused with the pinch to zoom gesture. So I had to disable pinch to zoom entirely. Now it works about most of the time but not 100%. Also sometimes when I'm using the track pad it'll just stop responding to my finger an the mouse cursor will stay in place. This is pretty annoying and happens a lot more than it should. Also to top it off the track pad just feels really plasticity and cheap.The screen is a TN panel so the colors look pretty dull and the vertical viewing angles are horrible. However the viewing angles from the side are almost as good as IPS.Overall I'm pleased with this laptop and would recommend it if you looking for a thin and light gaming laptop. However this laptop isn't perfect out of the box, you gotta be willing to take it apart and upgrade it to get the best experience."]}

I have a 17" ROG ASUS and a 15" Lenovo Y700, so I was expecting this machine to be at least equivalent. The performance is nice, and the specs are correct (ASUS FX503VD 15.6\xe2\x80\x9d FHD Powerful Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i7-7700HQ Quad-Core 2.8GHz (Turbo up to 3.8GHz) Processor, 4GB GTX 1050, 128GB SSD + 1TB HDD, 8GB DDR4, Windows 10). The things that stand out compared to my last two gaming laptops and that make it a 3 star (vs. 4 or 5) are:The good:Performance. This laptop does operate well with the processor and video card, not top tier, so you won\'t be playing games at full high settings, but you will notice better performance than a 960MX or similar.Upgrade accessibility. They did a good job with the access door to upgrade hard drives and memory, if you\'re looking to do upgrades, this laptop does make it much easier than ones I\'ve owned in the past.Stays cool. Seems to handle heat well, although I\'ve only used it on a fan cooled laptop pad.The bad:Build quality/feel. It feels like a really cheap computer. Cheap plastic bezel around the screen, keyboard, undercarriage.Operating noise. The fans will most likely be on full time, even at a low RPM (they are with this one).Even though on paper it\'s thinner smaller and lighter than my Lenovo Y700, when sitting next to each other, and putting them into my tight laptop they really end up feeling similar. Also with bag space, there\'s not a hug difference in fit. Probably because of the more boxy build of this ASUS vs the smooth curved build of the Y700.The fans are quite loud, even when using moderate operation. In fact, as I type this review I can hear the fans whirring even though I only have Outlook and Firefox open and running. If fan noise bothers you, I\'d recommend staying away from this model.The biggest issue I have is the perceived build quality. On my other laptops, when typing and handling the machine (it\'s designed to be transported right?) they feel pretty solid. This machine really doesn\'t feel very solid. When typing the surface around the keyboard even shakes and bends quite a bit more than my other two machines. Also, when I hold it while inserting into my backpack laptop sleeve, I hear cracking as the case flexes and it really gives an impression of poor build quality (unlike my previous ASUS ROG). Almost like I\'m not supposed to hold it with the lid closed. The seams where the bottom of the case meets the top of the case are not very clean, again giving an impression of poor build quality (I\'ll try to post pics).The speakers are pretty terrible, again compared to my ASUS ROG 17" and my Lenovo Y700 (both of those seem comparable to each other, with decent to good sound).The screen is pretty good.Overall I feel it\'s a solid 3 star laptop. It\'s not disappointing enough for me to return and pay the restocking fee, but I definitely wouldn\'t buy it again nor recommend anyone else to buy it. As a note, I\'d also not tell someone to NOT buy it, if they are ok with the downsides. I\'d recommend something more like the ASUS ROG Strix, if anyone were to ask, much better built machine in person.', b"I know this may be early as I've only had this laptop for a few day but here is my quick review.This laptop restarts and starts up very fast. 2-3 secs beast. The design and build is great, looks pretty. I work in television production and I bought this to edit and game. Seems to handle those areas so far. In the future I will upgrade to 16 ram.My only knocks is that it's a bit on the heavy side, and can get hot whilst gaming. A bit of noise if put under stress to but generally quiet.", b'Really solid build for the price.  Be sure you know how to deal with the dual HD setup, as everything wants to be installed on and stored on the little tiny C drive by default and it will fill up fast.  Display is nice, keyboard is great (even has mini 10-key pad), not too obnoxiously styled for a "gaming" laptop.  At the time I purchased it was the best deal I could find for a 15" laptop with a decent dedicated graphics card, 8gb ram (and can add more), and i7 processor.  The track pad is actually very good as well - much more usable than the last few laptops I\'ve had.  I am using as a desktop replacement, so can\'t really comment on heat or battery life since it sits on a desk and is usually plugged in.', b'Great overall laptop. As some of the reviews say, the fans are a little in the loud side, but take this with a grain of salt. When you are squeezing as many warm components into a tiny laptop, expect some extreme cooling, which the fans definitely take care of. I have played Fortnite and DOOM (2016); both on high play extremely well with properly updated GPU drivers. Only complaint I have is some of the keys stick slightly like the shift left key. Very satisfied though considering I paid $796 for it.', b"Used this laptop for a month and it's run really well. I played the Witcher 3 on high settings with no issues at all even when running for hours. As people said the screen is a bit flimsy, and the fans are noticeable, but honestly they were not as irritating as some people complained. At one time i did have the keyboard glitch but a reboot fixed it immediately. Lightning fast boot up.Great specs and amazing price, so of course some features are not top quality, but overall a really excellent budget gaming laptop.", b"I've been using this laptop a couple weeks now. I do voice-overs and produce music so I needed a machine that can allow me to edit media quickly. This does that. This does exactly that. There was minimal bloatware and the initial Windows 10 setup was easy peasy. I was ready to get to work within the hour. Now it takes about 9 seconds to turn on. 9 seconds... we exist in a beautiful future.Honestly, this is one of the best purchases I've made. I'm glad I chose this manufacturer. I had an awful experience with HP before. HP, never again. After that I had an Acer. Acer was pretty good, but Asus seems to be where it's at now. Long story short, this is my first Asus laptop and I'm more than satisfied with it. Oh baby.", b"This notebook has not worked properly from day-1. I was really excited for this to show up and the graphics card or some sort of driver issue is causing it to freeze constantly and the screen crashes. I've spent hours with tech support with ASUS (avoid Amazon tech support its awful) and the issues have not been resolved. I am barely able to use this notebook for casual work use and browsing the internet without it freezing and/or crashing. I wish I did not buy this computer and spent the extra few hundred dollars on a different model such as Acer or a Lenova (which I had and thought this would upgrade and the Lenova never stuttered once). I am now forced to take this computer which is brand new and only been using for a month somewhere and pay more money to a tech store or geek squad to get it to run like a normal computer should IF that even works. Extremely disappointed..", b'Just from using it for a few weeks now, I love this laptop to death! It has handled my games with ease and great speed!']}

People are clueless and blame the hardware. Run all the Windows updates as soon as you unbox it over Ethernet cable and not WIFI to avoid issues. Then after all Windows updates complete and you have OS Build 1709, right click the Dell updater in the icon tray next to the clock on the toolbar and scan for Dell updates and drivers.After doing all of these steps first, I have had zero lag, zero Chrome browser issues, etc. Lastly, go to Nvidia's website and install GeForce Experience. From there you can download and install the latest drivers for the GTX 1050. Most Motherboards have on-board graphics but when the Nvidia drivers are installed they take default GPU. I wish this laptop had a metal chassis but for the price point I'm being unrealistic. The plastic case really isn't that bad. Buy this thing and have no regrets.", b"Notes (05/02/2017):- Make sure to update all drivers on Dell's website, for some reason their software do not pick up the new updates- Experienced some glitches as well as some malfunctioning with headphone jack drivers, but everything is working fine so far.- Battery life is impressive. Being doing papers and projects on Adobe Muse, Illustrator, Photoshop, Word, Excel as well as browsing for at least 4-5 hours solely on battery.", b"Pros:-Excellent Dell customer service (I asked them to have a look at cpu and gpu for overheating. They replaced my motherboard, fans and heat pipes via an onsite engineer without question)-Cheapest gaming rig for this specs.-Very long battery life - 10 hours (I take it school w/o charger and it runs all day)-It runs anything for now.-3 USB 3.1s, 1 of which is thunderboltCons:-128GB SSD is merely enough for Windows 10. I ended up installing all the games on HDD.-It weighs 3 kg, charger is 0.5 kg not good for everyday carry around.-Screen is not very bright and has narrow view angles.-Bass is at the bottom. Creates vibration on top of a solid ground such as a table.-Fans get loud under load. But that's a generic laptop problem.", b'The good:Hardware, very good performance for a portable.Keyboard and trackpad are nice if you are into using those.Display  looks good,Decent battery life considering  the hardware, about  4h30min.The OK:Red accents not as gaudy as expected.Still a bit gaudy but beats paying double the price for a non gaming laptop with similar hardware.The annoying:This is a common thing with "gaming" laptops, dual GPUs, intel and nvidia one, if you add a USB display you need 3 drivers that don\'t really work well with each other. I ended up setting up a script that reinstalls whichever driver  I want to use.The bad:As with most laptops bloatware ridden win10,  I recommend zeroing it out and installing something decent.Speakers, you don\'t expect good speakers on a laptop but dell has outdone themselves with these ones, they are worse than 20 year old blown out drive-thru speakers used to sell questionable tacos.', b"Once I finally got the cash I spent a month deciding on which laptop was the most bang for my buck. This is the budget gaming laptop I've been looking for. I don't just game either. I do data analytics and photo/video editing. This handles it all. Also, with the design when I'm in a public space it doesn't scream GAMER.It's a little heavier than I'd like, but I'm not a fragile old man so it doesn't really bother me. Everything is easily upgradable. Literally one screw pops out and you can reach the hardeive and memory. This will be great for first timers. The screen needs to be replaced. The viewing angles are awful. You can get another screen for about $25 and replacement looks pretty easy. It's like putting legos together.After a screen replacement I don't think there's another laptop that has the build quality or power for this price.", b'I compared a bunch of different laptops suitable for gaming and work. This one was the best price for the specs I was looking for. Build quality is nice. It doesn\'t feel cheap. It has a matte, slightly rubbery finish which feels nice. No, the screen is not an ips panel but it still looks pretty good. I have high quality monitors for my desktop and this screen doesn\'t bother me a bit. It can run most of the newest games on medium settings. I get 50-60 fps on BF1 and that\'s without any further tweaking. I thought the red accents would turn me off but it actually looks pretty nice. Not too "loud" or bright. The fans do get a bit noisy but not too bad to where it\'s annoying. Overall, I would say this is a great gaming laptop in it\'s price range. It boots fast and runs windows applications very quickly thanks to the ssd and i7. Almost as quick as my desktop with an i7, GTX 1080, 16gb ram, etc. You really don\'t need more than 8gb of ram unless you are doing some serious multi tasking.', b"I've had the laptop for two months and haven't had a single issue. It runs clean and is very responsive. I had to upgrade the RAM because I do virtualization and some machine learning stuff, but the fact that all I had to do is supply more RAM is a testament to the quality of the laptop. Also, after installing the new RAM the boot time went down noticeably. Power-on to login screen takes about 5 seconds.For those interested, this is the RAM I bought:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BIWKP58/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"]}

I just want a graphics card to run little editing stuff and light gaming. 1050 2GB for heavy gaming? You can dream about it.......The speaker amazed me! It is almost the same as using headphone when I listen to my favorite music, but you have to be right in front at the computer.Overall, the performance is good; the CPU is the lastest and fast.The keyboard is quite good and comfortable.I don't really like the red line design but I rather it is plain steel.The battery can let you use about 4.5 hours if you just internet and youtube.The wifi works perfectly like the advertising. It works well even though I am a little far away from the router and have a wall in between.The fan is not noisy, and the thermal control is very good. I feel slightly warm when I am using it to light works.I do recommend you buy the SSD version though. It is quite slow when I trying to install software even though it is an SSHD.I will add an SSD later.", b"This thin and light notebook computer was not purchased for gaming but for work.  It has the correct components for how I use it, plus, it has an 8th generation intel cpu, has room for a SSD, and for up to 32GB of ram, unusual for an ASUS, but a pleasant surprise, from my past experience with ASUS, having made three previous purchases.  In my business, I am constantly downloading large files (3-4 GB) and then watching the digital footage, maybe editing it, and re-editing it.  This notebook is perfect for how I use it, and it's light and seems sturdy, though the case appears to be all plastic.  It doesn't have as many USB ports as I'd like, but it has enough for the price point (isn't that why they have USB hubs?) and, of course, no optical drive, but I have a nice blu-ray external drive that cost me about $20, which is small, light, and handy to carry in the carry sleeve I bought to go with the notebook.  It would nice if it had a docking station of some sort, but that wasn't a deal breaker, just an afterthought.  The most important lesson I learned is to read the warranty before you buy the product, because, this one is only 1 year (which I knew), will not be extended by the manufacturer, which I didn't know, (leaving you to wrestle with the decision whether or not to take your chances or go with a third party warranty company that I have found, in the past, is a useless expense and then there is also, insurance that can be purchased, but I haven't done that either or ever) and allows the manufacturer to pick up almost anything off the street to replace or repair parts that need replacing or repairing, &, if they work, then it's fixed so far as the manufacturer is concerned; they've discharged their obligation under their warranty.  Had I to do it all over, I would pick a manufacturer that only made repairs and replacements with new parts, if any exist out in the notebook world, or maybe they are all like that (haven't had time to read the other warranties, yet, but will before my next purchase).  Analysis at this point is that was a smart purchase and everything functions as it should, though a ram upgrade is in the near future, as 8 gigs is tasked every time I use the machine, but adequate for now.  I would buy another one, at this point, because of the price point, and pray it doesn't need any repairs.  However, for 3-4 hundred dollars more, maybe a better warranty and machine could be had; that extra 3-4 hundred was not in my budget so I didn't really look.  I'll be back if any important updates are in order.", b'UPDATE: ASUS asked me to return the laptop for keyboard repairs. Turns out there is no option to purchase onsite warranty or extended warranty here in the US. The whole process could take 2-3 weeks. So I returned the laptop back to amazon. The return process was swift and easy. Watch out for the limited one year warranty, there is no way to extend that. I\'d suggest looking at the DELL G3 and G5 which was just released which is way better at the same price.Delivery: Very prompt delivery. Came in a Amazon box. The ASUS box inside had two puncture marks (I\'ve attached the photos). Thankfully the deeper puncture mark missed the  laptop and went through the cardboard skirting that holds the laptop in place inside its box. The ASUS Laptop box was also placed upside down. If the whole package was kept on the floor the only thing between the ground and the laptop were two sheets of cardboard. All the air filled cushioning material was on the wrong side. It\'s lucky that USPS handled it carefully and nothing broke on the outside. Still a little worried about the effect that might have had on the HDD.About the laptop:This was just launched like 3 weeks before it was ordered. So I was skeptical about the initial hiccups new range of laptops come with.Pros:1. The keyboard keystrokes are sublime. And its a full sized keyboard with the NumPad. The red backlight comes in three brightness levels and an option to turn it off. (There are issues with the backlight which I\'ve covered in the latter portion which I hope is just a defect in this particular laptop and not the whole range)2. The processor is pretty good. Almost on par with and in some ways better than the i7-7700HQ for anyone confused between the two.3. The graphics card is not that great but for the price of $699 it is sufficiently good.4. The cooling fans are very very effective but insanely noisy. Played Battlefield 3 on ultra settings and after a while the middle section of the keyboard was pretty warm/hot but the WASD area was almost at room temperature. You could feel the negative air pressure pulling air into the fan through the keys in that general area (No Idea if this is a good thing or bad)5. The trackpad has a nice feel to it but a slightly noisy click.6. The speakers are really good!7. Not a lot of preinstalled bloatware.Cons:1. The screen is FHD but just not that good. Like really bad viewing angles. Previously had a 14" TN screen that I could live with, but on this bigger screen light quantity varies a lot from the top the bottom of the screen.2. The SSHD is slow and isn\'t the most silent. It makes tiny clunking noises.3. Battery life is really bad. 2-3 hours is the most you can get out of this even on battery saver.4. The fans are really noisy!Stuff that might just be wrong with the device I received and not necessarily the product line:1. The backlight flickers when it is kept at the lowest brightness level. I\'ve attached a video of it too. The flickering you see is not due to the camera but the backlights on the keyboard.2. A portion of the F9 key is not lit up. a part of the LEDs beneath the key are not lighting up.I guess I\'ll have to contact ASUS regarding this. Really not pleased about this.Overall it is a pretty good laptop for the cost. Another one in this range that might be as durable as this one is DELL insprion 15 5000 gaming. This one just looks way too cooler and was made for gaming.I\'ll add new stuff as I discover it about this laptop.', b"One of the best gaming laptops for the price. PUBG runs very well on medium graphics and still looks pretty damn good. Most games will run superb on High/Ultra settings. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase."]}
{'asin': 'B006HFJA12', 'title': 'Amazon.com: SwissGear 1900 Scansmart TSA Laptop Backpack - Black: Computers & Accessories', 'price': '', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b'Update after a few weeks of use: I still love this pack! I have my transit pass tucked into one of the cup holders so I can easily reach it when I get on the train/bus. ALSO, I\'ve added a picture of some rain that sat on the fabric, and hasn\'t absorbed after a 30 min train ride.I am in love with this backpack and it just arrived today. I\'ve returned a couple backpacks to Amazon in my search for the right one, and this is probably the One.It\'s very sturdy, with great back padding and a deep air flow channel, along with mesh backed straps to allow for air flow around your shoulders. The straps are comfortable when wearing the pack, and the seams are flexible and don\'t cut into my arms. The Heather Gray fabric is the same water resistant material you find on good quality backpacks, though it looks like cotton canvas in the pics.All pockets have large capacity. The top front pocket is roomy and about 7-8" deep. The side pockets behind the water bottle mesh are a whole 12" deep, and could probably fit a dress shoe on each side, for commuters or travelers (maybe this is why there are 2 grommet holes on each?) The inner pocket is surprisingly wide, at 5-6"at the base, and you could stuff much more in there, since the front of the pack is flexible. There are 2 dividers inside, to organize papers or folders.The handle has a solid molded core, covered in the fabric and grip handle.The zippers are smooth, and it\'s easy to open the scansmart lay flat pocket. This pic shows a 15" laptop on the large pocket, a 10" asus tablet and a kindle paper white in the tablet pocket. There is plenty of room for a larger laptop. The laptop pocket also has a padded arm that secures with Velcro, and holds the laptop steady, and the pocket also has good padding at the base, fot when it\'s set on the floor.I\'m can say that I like every feature about this backpack so far.My ONLY complaint is that it should come with a user guide to explain all of the features. There is a sunglasses loop. The mesh water bottle pockets are elastic at the top, and have adjustable straps around them. There\'s a carabiner on the front (behind the Swiss gear tag in the pic) What are the little loops with up/down arrows at the top of each strap for??', b"I was initially a little concerned about purchasing this pack because of the negative reviews regarding the zipper quality. When it first arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find the zippers were all very big and the quality felt great. This pack is big and has more than enough room for my laptop, tablet, books, and all my other small stuff.I really wanted to leave a positive review on this pack but unfortunately there were a few issues that are deal breakers.First, unfortunately the zipper did break on my pack. What happened is the stitching started to come out of the seam around the zipper and was getting caught in the teeth and eventually broke the teeth of the zipper within weeks of owning the pack. I didn't realize how serious it was until one day while standing in a crowded conference one of the zippers broke apart at that point and my laptop fell out and hit the floor behind me. Luckily my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 is well built and had a good case on it so it wasn't hurt but would have been toast without a case.Second, the service from Swiss Gear has been completely non-existent. I contacted them because this was obviously a defect in their pack and it was only a few months old. I get no response except an extremely large email filled with all kinds of legal stuff about their responsibility and liability. No personal response, no responses when I replied with pictures of the damage and an clear explanation of what broke and where.I am more than disappointed in Swiss Gear on so many levels. I have multiple Camelbak backpacks and several of them are 15-20 years old now and this pack couldn't even last 1/2 a year. It's one thing to have products fail but to have no service to support customers when products fail is the deal breaker for me. I will never buy anything from Swiss Gear again.", b"This is a virtually identical review I wrote for the model SA1923, which I now use.I needed to replace my old laptop backpack and noticed many colleagues using the SwissGear line.  The difficulty in ordering one of these on-line is that there are a number of variations and the differences are subtle.  From everything I could learn an all websites, including Amazon, there were 2 models I was interested in. the SA1900 (this one) and the SA1923.  The photos are misleading. They are not necessarily unique to those specific models.  I had to order both packs and compare in-hand and send the one back that I didn't fit my needs.The only difference between these 2 models, besides the color, is this one has a compartment for an iPad opposite the laptop compartment in the section that opens up to lie flat on the airport's scanning conveyor. Thus, your laptop will be in one half and your iPad in the other as it goes through the scanner.  The SA1923 has a full width pocket for a slim folder or notebook in the iPad's location. All other compartments and sections of the pack are identical.  I loved the color red color of this one, which is unique, but I don't use an iPad and I wanted the pocket there for travel papers (itinerary, boarding passes, receipts, etc.) Also, keep in mind access to the laptop compartment is on one side only (right side while wearing the pack). The zipper goes from the top of the pack down the side.The pack is roomy and can old a lot. Probably more than I would really want to carry. My only complaint with both packs is I wish it had just a couple of other small zippered sections inside for small miscellaneous items often needed on business trips (e.g. medications, snacks, sunglasses or reading glasses, etc.).There are other models in this line that are smaller and more simple. If the features each offer is important, just don't rely on the pictures if they seem to be the same as other models."]}

Amazon plainly states that refurbished electronics should be reconditioned to look and function like new.At BEST, my laptop might qualify for the USED --Upgraded category. It seemed to have had a new hard drive and extra ram installed. And yes, it included Windows 10. But a few hardware upgrades do not count towards Amazon\'s clear definition of "refurbished."My computer arrived with serious cosmetic flaws. The unit had clearly been dropped at some point, as the scuff marks and dented casing were obvious on one corner, and loads of other scrapes and scuffs all around. Instead of being in "like new" condition, the computer looks like it was on loan from someone\'s little brother. The screen wobbled like the hinge mounting screws were loose, and the LCD itself had numerous dead pixels. The keyboard looked fine at first, but once I started typing, a sticky film appeared that I had to scrape off key-by-key because my fingers were sticking to the keys. Who knows what that stuff was!Worst of all was the battery. At the very least I\'d expect a refurbished laptop to come with a brand new battery. However, I noticed almost immediately that the battery drained quickly. After running the configsys battery report, I discovered that this battery was already down to 50% of its capacity, meaning that a full charge lasted only half as long as it should and that the battery was well on its way to being spent. This was the deal breaker. It is completely unacceptable that a product advertised as "certified refurbished" be shipped in such poor condition.I\'ve reached out to the seller for an explanation, but have not received a response. (Funny, since they seemed all too anxious to secure a five star review BEFORE I made my objections.) I will be returning for a refund. I strongly advise against purchasing this computer from this seller.', b"Everything the seller advertised was there - built-in webcam, HDMI port, etc. The vendor's product description was accurate. One review mentioned there wasn't a built-in webcam, but this laptop had one.I received the laptop yesterday and have been doing all the setup stuff to mirror my old Dell Win7 laptop, which I'm retiring. The laptop arrived on-time and was packed well. All that was in the box was the charger, the laptop, and the packing material. The laptop appears to be in pristine condition - no dings, scratches or blemishes. Once you get through the rather tedious initial boot up stuff (thanks Microsoft), you are greeted by a clean desktop that displayed only the recycle bin and Firefox (hurray!). The first software I installed was Classic Shell to rid myself of those annoying Win10 tiles and get a usable start menu. No extraneous software or crapware installed. Perfect! The computer is running fast and fine...for the moment. I will update this review should things change.One minor disappointment is that there is no microphone jack, though there is a headphone jack (I like to use a mic/earphone headset when doing Skype). That rather surprised me, but it is a minor complaint. The built-in mic works OK. The optical drive is read-only and knew that when I ordered, but I have an external burner (I rarely burn DVDs or CDs any longer). USB 3 would have been nice, but, again, I knew it was only USB 2, which is good enough. I haven't run the machine off the battery, so I don't know what condition it's in.With all the usual caveats, I recommend this refurbished laptop. I almost wish I had purchased another one (it only cost two average trips to the grocery store).UPDATE: Just a note that the Broadcom network adapter installed on this laptop is 802.11n. The adapter is 2.4GHz single band which means it is slower (dual band adapters are much faster). I have a network connection rated at over 100Mb/s, but I can only get download speeds of around 30Mb/s. This isn't necessarily a problem for most users, but it is a disappointment. For comparison my old Dell had a dual band adapter with download speeds of around 100Mb/s. Have removed one star in my rating. Nevertheless, it is still a good laptop for the money.UPDATE 2: To remedy the adapter download speed, I purchased a USB network adapter that can access the 5.8GHz band on my router. The cost of the adapter was $17 and it works great. Download speeds of up to 100Mb/s restored. Restoring my original rating of five stars to my review. The laptop is working great!UPDATE 3: After nearly seven weeks, the laptop is going strong. Having lived with it, I've not noticed anything unusual. Still very pleased with the purchase.", b"I love this laptop. Comes with everything you need: battery, charger, Windows 10, and setup takes 5 minutes. No glitching or anything; can't even tell it's refurbished. I'm happy it comes with a DVD player and webcam too. It's sturdy, and the hinges work smoothly- nothing feels like it'll break easily. The keys offer a smooth typing experience. The screen is bright and the sound is good and punchy.Altogether I'm in love with this laptop for all that it comes with for such a great price- you really cannot beat it."]}

My user experience has been responsive, stutter-less and reliable. I got the higher trim, and it is plenty powerful enough to comfortably edit HD videos and RAW photos. When I'm just writing or browsing, the fan rarely turns on, which gives me comfortable 5~6 hours of battery life. I can watch 2 movies back to back on battery.My only hesitation before I bought it was the screen. Watching YouTube reviews on another screen didn't give me an accurate sense of what the screen will look like. And budget laptops tend to skimp on screens. So I just rolled the dice and was pleasantly surprised! The matte screen reminds me of late 2000s 15 inch Macbook pro, the last all-silver models, which I enjoyed tremendously. I definitely prefer matte over glossy screens. The color is vivid and not wild, and very consistent all over the screen.The body and keyboard do not feel as solid as heavier and more expensive metal laptops. But it weight that much less, and Asus did a great job with coating so it does not look or feel cheap.This is my second Asus laptop, and if they keep it up like this, they'll have all my future computer money!", b"Bought this computer mainly for video & photo editing. It's fast, light, has a great screen, and runs very smoothly. The only negative is that the battery life is NOT even close to 8 hours, more like 4 hours running a word document to be totally honest. If you're playing a game or doing any intense editing then it only lasts like 2 hours tops. So I guess the bottom line is this is not the best laptop for gaming or editing but runs perfectly for anything else.", b"Very good student/work laptop that features full 15.6 inch screen yet light. Powerful enough for mid-tier hefty productivity such as video editing and heavy compiling, and light gaming, but not for heavy gaming at all.I bought this laptop for work and it does everything I need well without any problems.You are also able to put in 8 more gb of RAM if you would like since there's a slot for it.Pros:- Very thin laptop that is easy to carry- Very good performance to price ratio- High quality build quality and material- Sleek design for professional looks- Silver-gold color that does not attract too much attention- Good screen and brightness- Good heat managementCons:- Does not come with any complimentary case- No Windows Hello capability- I use a wireless usb mouse, but the touchpad can be a little bit twitchy at times- Screen reflection indoors- No CAPSLOCK indication- Relatively short charging cords- Mediocre battery, but I do have a dedicated graphics card and 2 storage units.", b"I've had this now for a month and have had zero issues with it. I bought this primarily to get me through Grad school and I simply did not want to carry my heavy 6 year old Alienware M14x to class anymore.The Asus is much lighter, powers up/down fast, runs silent, and thinner than what it replaced.", b"Review update after two weeks. It has Russian sticker on keyboard. I'm not sure why. Maybe my laptop  came from Russia??? The top lid of lcd is somewhat loose, quality issue? Right click of touch pad get stuck sometimes.Other than that, super fast boot up. I like that exhaust fan is located on top of the keyboard, although a little bit noisy when fan kicks in.", b'The machine is quite fast, excellent display, light and thin. My only complaint is that the power button is where the delete button was on my last computer. It took me a while to get out of the habit of hitting it. Fortunately, that just puts the computer in sleep mode and it comes right back on.', b'Over all a great laptop. i purchased the 256GB SSD version. The laptop boots quickly, runs smoothly, great battery life, and features decent graphics. The main problem i have with this device is the noise level. at high CPU usage the fan gets really sound and it irritating.', b"I purchased this Item on Feb 22, 2018, received it two days later. I was quite excited about the lightweight, memory capacity and the short start up time.However, my excitement was short-lived. After using this notebook for 6 weeks it stated to freeze, currently it freezes about 4 times every week, and I literally have to hard restart each time, reopen everything I was previously working on hoping they auto-saved. I have reached out to ASUS team,  have been asked to mail it in, the problem however is, I will have to bear the cost for shipping one-way, it will take 10 days to fix the problem at their facility, plus X days in transit back and forth.With no stopgap provided by ASUS, I am not sure what my coping mechanism will be for about 3 weeks without my workstation. I'm extremely disappointed at the poor after sales service and will not recommend this purchase, as you are left to dry should any issues/ factory defects arise."]}

I thought I was upgrading from my 5 year old desktop and here I am.. on my desktop instead of the laptop. The camera quality is awful and I need it for my home business. Not worth the money.', b"Do not buy this product for battery power.  I have been testing it out since I got it last week and at 50% power/brightness it lasts about 2-2.5 hours total. Very disappointing. I haven't put anything on it so far. it isn't overloaded with apps trying to run. I have only used it for email and basic web browsing to see what it could handle powerwise (i am still using my old computer for all my regular work).  Obviously this is NOT a traveling laptop if it cant even last 3 hours at 50% powersetting.  I have never had a computer that lasted less time on battery power than this one.", b"The HP laptop was good quality for the price. The only complaint i have is about the battery. The description of the product clearly stated the battery life after charging is 9 hours. After receiving the laptop and using it for a few days, i found out the battery life is only 2-1/2 hours from a full charge. So I called Amazon and told them about my compliant about the battery issue. They connected me with a HP Technician and he told me that the 9 hours was how long it would last from a full charge if it wasn't used. He proceeded to tell me if i used the laptop after a full charge I would only get  2-1/2 hours of use. The product description does not mention anything about the battery only getting 2-1/2 of use after a full charge. I have been a customer of Amazon's since Amazon has been around and if you check your records, i have many purchases over the years. Your ad for this laptop was very misleading and if I would of known this I wouldn't have purchased this computer. Regards, Glenn", b'I love everything about the computer so far, except the inner "rim" of the top half of the laptop, which folds down to outline/surround the keyboard keeps leaving residue on the bottom half of the laptop. I\'m OCD about it and keep having to clean the line up.But other than that, the machine runs the smoothest I\'ve ever had a laptop run, and I love the color of it. It\'s usually so quiet, and does get really hot. I also love the feel of the keyboard and that it has a backlighting option (sometimes a necessity for me). It\'s the lightest 15" computer I\'ve had!', b'First of all this is not a laptop. This is an ultra book. There is no cd/dvd drive. The harddisk included is very slow and noisy and will hinder the entire experience. It should have had at least a 500gb ssd. The speakers are great. The screen is very good and the overall appearance is satisfactory. It is only the very slow and noisy hdd that is ruining the experience.', b"I bought this computer used as a I believe refurbished or open box. Once I got it up and running and started I rebooted it one time and it crashed. I did have one prior to this of the exact same make and model. Except my previous one was a touch screen and it had a CD / DVD player. That one works very very well and was super fast until it didn't update and one of the USB ports just stopped working altogether. After numerous resets I gave up and sold the thing.", b'It is  good but it is not a 2018 model. It is 17 inch. Need a mouse. The touchpad is a bit difficult to use. The USB are on left side and there is only one  slot on the right side. It suits a  left hander more']}

Will try to be as detailed as possible.* THE GOOD:+ 17" diagonal LCD IPS screen providing native 1920x1080 resolution.+ nVidia GTX 1070 graphics.+ Illuminated keyboard + keypad.+ Hotkey /  macro profiles on the left side, switch button allows to store up to 15 macros+ OS very clean, not a lot of bloatware to complain of and the Acer utilities include a wi-fi analyzer which in turn allows to configure better wi-fi channels for better network performance.+ 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key SSD + 1Tb 7200 SATA HD.+ 16Gb RAM out of the box plus 2 easy access slots on the back for expansion.+ USB 3.0 ports layout is good, not spread all over and spaced nicely to connect multiple devices without blocking each other.* THE BAD:- Heavy and large but again its 17" made for gaming or to replace a desktop so deal with it.- Proper gaming sessions require power brick connected, power brick rated for 230W output.- Quick start guide very simple instructions, you actually need to download the manual to learn most of its tricks.- 2x128Gb M.2 (B+M) key in RAID-0 configuration. (Read below)- Locked "InsydeH20" BIOS. (Read below)- Basic optical media, DVD reader / writer, my previous computer was an HP Pavilion dv6 and could read Blu-Ray discs.Let me give you my biggest beefs to a couple of the "BAD" things.* Having 2 SSD drives is a big bonus, but using them in a RAID-0 array its pointless, because they are SSD\'s, they are fast already and the RAID-0 gain in so minimal that the computer actually wastes time writing on 2 devices instead of 1.* This problem with RAID 0 is compounded due the fact that Acer decided to lock the BIOS so the SATA mode is set to RAID and preventing end users to change it. Again this is a major mistake. In the event of RAID array failure the user cannot reinstall software or may not recover at all since the configuration setting is locked.At this point some of you who know how to work with RAID-0 arrays may think. "Surely that kind of problem is very rare."Sadly it is not, before this review I received this same computer and while running it through its paces the RAID array failed.Because RAID was locked in BIOS I could not use an image I made at first and the Acer recovery tools and recovery management were unable to reinstall the software or rebuild the array from scratch.This also prevents users from upgrading to bigger SSD drive sizes, I am unaware of the RAID array will be rebuilt on a bigger SSD drive, plus the SSD slots and space for them may cause problem installing a new SSD. (See pictures)Acer really needs to unlock the BIOS and give the option to the users to configure the computer as they see fit and its not really that hard. After speaking with Acer support he claimed that users can unlock the BIOS but its not Acer\'s policy to disclose how to do it. So I assume the unlock procedure is just a backdoor or master password to unlock all features.Now a bit on the good side:This is a laptop computer but you want to use it on a table for comfort, when its running at full speed it gets warm BUT the lap portion remains relatively cool. Using the overclocking options the most heat came from the rear away from the lap and even away from the keyboard, even graphic-intensive games were run very smoothly at "Ultra" settingsIn the end I think the GOOD overcome the BAD and its a solid purchase for both work and entertainment for the next couple years and if Acer stops trying to tie leashes on the customers it will be a great purchase for everyone else.** 08/12/2017 A bit of more updates. **Around 1 month after I got the computer have used it to convert movies with handbrake and while all 4 cores work at full I see no extra heat coming out from the back, heat output remains at a steady 97F-98F.While people like to use test programs like heaven and others I prefer to use somewhat intensive applications.I run Second life at Ultra settings and Space Engineers online and they both run quite smoothly, very little (if any) visual lag.The most delays I notice is when using the SATA hard drive for the programs but using the SSD\'s pretty much prevents that.Still trying to get ACER to spit the BIOS backdoor/master password to unlock all features but no success so far.** 08/22/2017 More updates. **With the help from ACER predator forums I learned I could update from the 2x128Gb RAID-0 to a single 512Gb NVMe M.2 stick by removing both SSD\'s and placing the new one then restore a full backup upon the new drive so as not lose any existing data. (No need to make changes to BIOS except boot order)The process took 2 or 3 tries before getting it right but it worked, with the single NVMe drive the predator is not just fast.It flies!Loading time from Power-Up to Windows 10 login is 7 seconds flat.Afterwards I connected one of the remaining 128Gb sticks to the M.2 SATA connector and using Inter Rapid Storage GUI inside windows broke its RAID setting so I can use it instead to install programs on it.So now I have 3 drives:1x512Gb NVMe M.2 SSD stick.1x128Gb SATA M.2 SSD stick1x1Tb SATA 7200 HD.', b"This laptop is absolutely amazing, everything came in perfect. I am always worried about getting a lemon when buying a gaming laptop, and all the reviews out there.After deleting the bloatware, and upgrading all my drivers, this machine is a absolute beast.The price I got mine at was good as well, being that the MSI, and Asus equivalents where a bit more. Me being a solid Asus ROG series man for years I was leary jumping ships but so far I am extremely pleased.The vents, and the extra cool fan you can pop in keep this thing extremely cool.I messed around a little with the overclocking and it got a little warm, but I don't see why you would want to since it runs most tittles with ease.All around I would highly recommend this gaming laptop to anyone.", b"First off, I want to say that I am incredibly happy with my purchase. After doing a lot of research on laptops with great build quality, specs, and price, I settled on the Acer Predator 17. The amount of sheer horsepower this laptop has is simply incredible. You can easily run any game on max settings with 70+ FPS. I'm really enjoying playing Fortnite, Dark Souls 3, Overwatch, and Witcher 3 on maximum graphics and buttery smooth framerates. With my opening remarks out of the way, let me get started on the details!In my review, I'm going to try to break down each aspect of this laptop to help you make an informed purchasing decision.-----------------PREFORMANCE: 10/10Okay, I pretty much already said this in the intro, but this laptop is an absolute MONSTER in terms of sheer power. This is rocking a 7th gen intel i7 7700HQ and a NVIDIA GTX 1070. If you're not caught up on hardware, let me just tell you that these specs are simply incredible. Nvidia's new Pascal GPU arcitecture on the GTX 10-series really shines through and gives you beautiful performance in all gaming tasks. The processor is incredible as well. Additionally, you're also given 16 GBs of RAM and a nicely sized SSD, so boot up times are speedy and you can run plenty of software concurrently.KEYBOARD AND MOUSE: 10/10This is not something I can explain to you in a review. This is something you have to experience in person. The keyboard and touchpad on this laptop are seriously top notch. The keyboard has a nice, satisfying click with substantial feedback and a nice, quiet clack sound; it really feels like a quality piece of hardware. Same goes for the trackpad and the buttons.Oh, and the rainbow backlight is absolutely incredible. It\xe2\x80\x99s something you have to see in person to appreciate.DISPLAY: 7/10The display is beautiful with vibrant colors and good brightness, but there are a few issues I want to point out. First, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say it \xe2\x80\x94 it has a 1080p display. You can see individual pixels if you look closely, and frankly that\xe2\x80\x99s not a good thing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t go for a 4k display, but even a 1440p monitor would have fixed this problem.Apart from being low definition, another issue with the display is the refresh rate and latency. This laptop has a refresh rate of 60hz with G-SYNC, which means you can never have any games appear higher that 60fps, even if your GPU can handle rendering it at higher FPS. The latency is about 20ms, which means the display is about 0.02 seconds delayed on everything you do. This is fine for me, but serious gamers might not appreciate it.Overall the display is very vibrant and \xe2\x80\x9cgood enough\xe2\x80\x9d for the most part.DESIGN: 6/10I know this appeals to a lot of gamers, but frankly I think it\xe2\x80\x99s over the top and I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer a sleek black design. Seriously, who wants to go to Starbucks and open up their huge 17\xe2\x80\x9d laptop with bright red LED backlights and the words \xe2\x80\x9cPREDATOR\xe2\x80\x9d imprinted on the back? You\xe2\x80\x99re going to look like a goon, it\xe2\x80\x99s a simple as that. Some people might like it, but personally it\xe2\x80\x99s not for me.BUILD QUALITY & COOLING: 10/10This thing feels solid and substantial. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to say other than that in terms of build quality. It just feels\xe2\x80\xa6 great! As for cooling, the laptop ships with an extra fan that you can replace the DVD drive with. This keeps all computer components at a nice cool temperature even during the most demanding tasks. Fantastic build quality and cooling overall.ANNOYANCES:There are a few really annoying issues with this laptop. First and foremost, THERE ARE NO VOLUME ADJUSTMENT HOTKEYS. This means that if you want to change the volume while you're in a game or watching a movie, you have to Alt-Tab to the desktop and change the settings manually. I find this to be an EXTREME NUISANCE. I recently downloaded a program that lets me adjust volume from anywhere with Ctrl + Down / Up arrow, but this is not something I should have to install myself.Next, this laptop is really heavy. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit inconvenient to carry around and it\xe2\x80\x99s very tough to fit in a normal sized backpack.OVERALL RATING: 9/10All gripes aside, when it comes down to the actual \xe2\x80\x9ccomputing\xe2\x80\x9d part of this computer, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply amazing and you won\xe2\x80\x99t find anywhere near as good a price for similar specs and build quality.

It's SO pretty. It was very easy to set up ad get up and running. Had MS Office and internet in minutes.I don't mind the keyboard at all. No problems there.Video and sound are great.Only reason I knock off one star is that I don't like the touch pad. It's either over sensitive or not sensitive enough. Mouse will randomly slide across screen, have to hit the left and right tabs too hard. I ordered a mouse, and I'm sure after that it will be perfect!It is simple and streamlined. Probably wouldn't recommend for anything complex at all. But if you just want a low priced machine for word processing and basic internet, it's wonderful.", b"This will get the job done but don't expect anything fancy. It can be slow to boot and is beyond slow to update.", b'I love my new laptop! I like the size the color, the way it operates.  The only thing I am a little unhappy about this laptop only has a 3 hour battery life before needing charged.', b'I bought this for my mom since her old computer was so slow.  I thought that with the larger memory and larger storage and the fact that it is NEW - that it would be fast.  It is PAINFULLY SLOW.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to find a place to ask if there is something wrong with it...  I am terribly disappointed in the quality, the customer service and how slow this computer is.  It also said it came with \xe2\x80\x9cword\xe2\x80\x9d but turns out it\xe2\x80\x99s just the 30 day trial and now I have to buy word to add to a painfully slow computer.', b'Terrible experience.  Machine froze a few times. Had to do a complete reset. Finally froze with the start button lit up. No response from any keys. Tried to return it but Amazon wanted me to prepay the shipment internationally from Chile. It would cost 10 times of what DHL charge Amazon.Will have to settle for a local repair at my cost. And how I hate windows 10. This has a very small processor, 1 ghz about third of the size of my desktopwhich is 3ghz. For windows 10 not a good idea.Too bad! It is a handsome looking machine..', b"Comes with what may be the world's largest collection of bloatware.  The excessive bloatware makes navigating and simple uses of productive software a chore.  We feel like a time warp happened, this Ideapad yearns to be competitive with 2010-2012 laptops.  A true electronic disappointment.  A great example of unreasonable return limitations for devices which take time to unearth their lack of utility.", b"Ordered this for my mom, whose 76, as a Mother's day present. She wanted a laptop for months, but was was to nervous to buy one herself, she broke down in tears when she opened it. It was easy to set up and get going for her. There was one little issue with Windows 10 not booting up one day, so I told/showed her to hit the F5 button to get the home screen run the anti-virus and restart it again. She hasn't had any problems with it since. Can't wait to order one for myself!!", b"I ordered this for my mom a few months ago and she recently told me she doesn't have any sound. I looked and there isn't any software on the laptop. I contacted Amazon and they had me call the manufacture and they haven't responded to me yet."]}

It is especially good for using in bed.  It is well made and strong enough to hold even a heavier laptop.  It does not wobble at all.  The fans work by plugging in to a USB port on the laptop which I do not care for as it drains the laptop battery that much faster, but the ventilation holes in the tray for the fan provide very good ventilation and I have no problems with my laptop heating up.  To use this as a couch table as illustrated in the description for the item, the table actually stands at the end of the two legs and leans on the furniture so it would not be as stable as using it in a lap tray position.  This is not a problem because the tray will fit easily on most couches and armchairs.', b'It is kind of unbelievable how mobile devices can hurt me so badly. MRI shows tennis elbows on both sides, although I never used a racket, but because of holding the kindle/iPad 3+ hours every night on the bed. I should have equipped the bed table long while to avoid that. Hopefully, it is not too late. The adjustment of the two zigzag legs is not simple as it looks to be, because of the gravity center position. But just need to do it once. Also worked well for the Macbook.', b"Works, but design is far from perfect. Mouse pad is weakly made. It is small, non-durable and is bending when you leave your hand's full weight on it. Not much space to operate mouse at all, and I know 50% of users normally ignore trackpad on keyboard. Mechanics is also much to redesign - to change angle of one section you need to unlock and change angle of 1 or 2 other sub-sections. From engineering standpoint this does not make sense. But again, this stand is better than nothing, comparative to over-priced and heavy laptop stands advertising themselves at $200+. Market is ready for someone to come up with new truly user friendly and durable product. Made by engineers.", b"I have been using it a couple hours so far. I set it up to hold me keyboard and mouse so I can stand at my desk. I am one of those that's bangs on the keyboard when typing and it only wobbles when the keyboard is set all the way back (like in the picture). It's not a severe wobble, just enough to may punch another key along with the one you were aiming for.What I do not like about it is where you screw in the mouse holder is in the way of being able to lay the holder flat. If it would lay flat, there is no wobble. That's the only reason for four stars.", b"This is a great laptop stand to have inside the house. It is not big, so doesn't take up a lot of space. It is light so very easily to carry around if you need to bring it with you when you travel. I like how you can adjust the desired height that you want. You can use it on sofa, bed or anywhere basically. The aluminium tray is big enough to place your laptop there. Now I can sit comfortably on the carpet while working on my laptop!", b"Got this this table for my son's therapist, she had very bad car accident last month, have to spend a lot of time on the bed for recovery. don't know what to get for her, since she have to work with computer a lot for her paperwork due to the car accident. so I decided to get her his foldable table. Just got her thank you card today, she said, she love this table, it is lightweight, adjustable angle and very easy to set it up and storage away. I am so glad she love it. As a gift, the price is not too bad at all!!", b'Interesting design, and seems solid. Only part I am concerned about is how long the plastic  joints will last. Time will tell. Otherwise, a little wobbly, but very slight. You can actually lean your weight into the top of this while typing and it feels supportive and solid.The legs are made of aluminum and the laptop plate is. The mouse pad and the joints are made of plastic. I will update this review if it starts to show serious wear or durability issues.', b"This laptop stand is very reliable, sturdy, and flexible. It is attractive and grips the laptop well. Feels secure. It appears to be very well designed. I'm very happy with it, and I'm glad I bought it. I'll also use it to elevate my new macbook when using my external monitor with creative projects. This exceeded my expectations. Easy to put together."]}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

Folks spend more time in browsers than anywhere else and having something that mostly lives in the cloud helps to avoid backup procedures, supports versioning of documents and is easy to support. Essentially, we're back to remote terminals...and it's a good thing.But none of that's about this Chromebook, which is pretty doggone nice. The regular old HDMI jack is a plus...though I think Chromebooks all ought to use the new USB/C standard for charging, like most this one doesn't...and the simple power plug is easy to insert...unlike say a directional microUSB.

It's lightweight, compact. I opened the box, turned it on and within minutes I was logged in (using my wifi password and google account log in). It's basic. But it serves my needs perfectly (web browsing and google drive are all I need).  There isn't a caps lock button, so it's going to take some time for me to get used to pressing alt and search. I'm hoping there is a shortcut to this. (I just got it last night). Highly recommend if you are looking for a, as my husband called it, a 'phone w a larger screen and a keyboard'. Again, perfect for my needs.Edit / I discovered that you can make the search key a short cut for other options. I selected mine to be caps lock and now I love this Chromebook even more.", b"It won't show my Google photos and it really puts a damper when I'm trying to post for dogs to get adopted and my pictures are not loading.."]}

Be careful of this seller, no guarantee that you will receive a laptop with the advertised SSD.', b'Fantastic performance for the price.  I would recommend this to anyone and buy it again.  Just uninstall the Dell bloatware and you are set!', b'Great price on a great product. Everything was as described. Has been a great daily laptop for my mother. This is coming from someone who does IT as a profession on a high level.', b'After reading many ads for a laptop computer I chose theBusiness Dell Inspiron 15.6" LED-Backlit-keyboard Display Laptop  Bluetooth Windows 10-Gray.So far, I\'m very pleased with all the features it offers, especially the light up keyboard.It is a sturdy laptop and appears to be well made.I hope to get many years of use from this Dell laptop.I don\'t give many 5 star ratings, only because I don\'t "love" things.However, this is one of those times it deserves the notability.', b'Overall great machine for a good price. Excellent build quality. Excellent sound. Keyboard backlit...awesome!Mine did not come with a power cable from wall outlet to charger/adapter.Display/Screen clarity could be better.', b'Bought this for my wife for Christmas.  At times, she complains about the computer "hanging up" for a few seconds- where she can\'t open or close browser or programs - then it kicks in - I\'m surprised this happens with all the ram, processor speed, AND solid state HDD.I\'m assuming it\'s because of some bloatware that Dell/Microsoft in their infinite wisdom decided to install.  I\'m sure if I spent a few hours diagnosing and streamlining it, I could improve the performance -  but when I spend money for a new laptop - I expect it to work right without me \'tinkering\' with it.  How hard is it for a computer company to build a fast, streamlined PC and sell it?  Most consumers don\'t have the knowledge or patience to work thru these issues.Also, Wifi reception could be better.  She\'ll be in our rec room which is furthest from our router and have connection issues.  I have zero issues sitting next to her in the same room with either my Samsung cell phone or my Dell Latitude company laptop.', b'I got this specifically for a replacement portable office machine. Two hours after I got this I was running Linux Mint 18.2 without a single hiccup. It picks up my 27" monitor and all of my hardware. It did take a few tries to get the monitor into 1080p mode. It took longer for windows to upgrade itself and add bloatware during the initial startup thank it took for Mint to load upgrade and go into service. I\'ve used linux in my office machines for several years now and have yet to encounter a crash or single virus/malware incident. Any important software such as Quickbooks that only works with windows is now also cloud based anyway. Bottom line, this is a great linux machine', b"This laptop serves its purpose for me (emails, movies, surfing the web and simple word documents etc). The sound quality does suck tho; so get speakers. Love thr number pad on the side. Only issue I had was a brief scare with it acting up and wouldn't allow me to log in, gave me a blue screen. I thought it was over! I'm not super tech savy but still know my way around for a little above the basics so I managed to fiddle in the advanced options and got it back - phew! Hope it's not the start of something."]}

Not as advertized', b"After 8 months of use for schoolwork, laptop started to randomly shut down and no updates seem to have fixed the problem. Laptop seems to have gotten even slower over time. Takes forever to open programs such as MS Word even when no other programs are open. Battery life in the beginning used to be good but now the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge as good as it did before. Screen has a very bad light glare and this purchase has turned out to be a very bad investment as it is not even worth the 200-300 dollars that Amazon is charging for it.", b'I bought this computer for my son to work on school projects on. I turned it on and begin trying to use it and it is like a computer from the 1990s as far as how slow it is. I\xe2\x80\x99m very familiar with windows 10 as I have a Dell, but this computer has such a slow processing speed that it\xe2\x80\x99s completely unenjoyable to use. You can simply typing seems like a chore as there\xe2\x80\x99s a delay. I sent it back. I have had numerous HPs and was always pleased with them but this is kind of a disgrace.', b'Surprisingly slow, even for a relatively cheap laptop.  Hard drive failed after about 3 months.  Looking into repair solution.  Addendum: Spoke with HP Customer Support and thought they were excellent.  Felt this was important to note.  Adding an extra star just for this and advising folks to spend on the extra warranty.  Cheers.', b'I knew when I bought this thing I should have done more research! Its so slow it makes me want to pull my hair out! And, it has crashed more than once leaving me wanting to scream!But, other than giving me a sore throat and making me go bald, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad computer if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to wait.', b'I use for internet and Word only. Slow and randomly restarts for no apparent reason without warning! Reasonably IT intelligent person (at least above average)... Not virus, not over-"worked"- but a bad cheap computer. \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9', b'Nice light weight laptop. A little slower than expected for starting up and opening programs.

I use all three USB ports: USB3s for two HDDs and USB2 for wireless mouse receiver.  All the ports work except for the headphone port.  It only works if I firmly press and hold the jack in the port.  As a remedy, I\'ll look into buying a Bluetooth headphone.  I am using the DVD drive to install some of my programs and it is working well.  Overall. I\'m pleased with the laptop hdwe and sfwe at the price ($549) and with Prime delivery.June 10, 2018 Update:  I added 8GB memory (total now 16GB) and a 2.5" 7mm 5400rpm 1TB HDD (installed in a 9.5mm high caddy which replaces the DVDRW drive).  HP Maintenance Guide and HP Laptop YouTube videos provided the necessary DIY instructions.', b'I bought this because I was starting a business. It booted up right away and I didn\'t have any problems going through the Microsoft Windows setup process with Cortana. A little annoying that Cortana wants to yap at you and I\'d rather just go through the process quietly. Once started, I found it to be fast.My biggest concerns for this were the 256 GB SSD and the only 8 GB of RAM. So far I\'ve seen no problem with the RAM. And the SSD operates with good speed as the system boots up from a dead shutdown in probably 20s or less. It wakes from a state of shutdown to the Windows security screen in about 10 seconds,which is faster than a Dell laptop I use for my day job.Overall I\'m pretty happy with this. One issue: it had Office installed on it, and I was pleased with that, but then it expired avfter 30 days and I realized I still had to buy it. I couldn\'t get around the necessity to create an account with Microsoft, which is very annoying. I don\'t want an account with Microsoft and I have no desire to be owned by them any more than I have to. It was irritating to have to buy a downloadable $130 license to Microsoft Office after I already spent nearly $600 on this. I wish they were more transparent about it.Lastly, HP has a pesky background "assistant" that they install on all their computers. I also have an older home "all in one" PC that is an HP product and the assistant software really bogs it down. I uninstalled all of the unnecessary HP nanny-ware and the computer seems no worse for the wear as a result.', b'Great computer. Super lightweight. lots of power.']}

Keys highly visible in darkness with the red back-lit feature. The display resolution, color, clarity, and brilliance is amazing! This baby can handle existing games at highest settings as well as many of the new titles that are out/will be out. Can't wait to see how it handles Sea of Thieves next month, but based on the recommended game settings from the publisher, it looks like it will handle the game very well at medium to high settings.Cons (Not a big deal though):1. No light indicator to let you know if your Caps, Num or Scroll locks are on or off.2. While gaming, the fan gets pretty loud after a while. Not really an issue if you wear a headset, but keep your left hand away from the exhaust vent. That air blowing out is HOT!Lastly, this is a complaint about Amazon regarding their shipping department. Would it KILL Amazon to use some padding?The laptop arrived in an Amazon box - Which contained the laptop in it's original packaging and a little bit of brown paper. I opened it to find it damaged (Not sure if it was from shipping or from the Manufacturer when packing). Sent it back for a replacement. 2 days later the replacement arrived.....Same kind of Amazon box with the product inside, only this time there was NO PACKING MATERIAL AT ALL. It was just the product box by itself.....Seriously Amazon?Luckily, the replacement was undamaged. As of this review, it's been up and running for 3 and a half days now without problems.First 2 photos are the first laptop that was damaged on arrival. The rest are of the replacement.", b'Unfortunately I had to return this laptop.  Here\'s why:The machine I received will not charge the battery.The first day I received it, I charged it all day.After more than 8 hours of charging, I unplugged it, and took it into my den to use while I watched TV.  I noticed that the battery indicated 100% charge several hours after I had unplugged it, and did not give that much thought except to think wow, this machine has a pretty strong battery.Sometime after that, the machine suddenly died.I plugged it in, and the next morning noticed that it had not charged, and the battery icon had an "X" in it.  Clicking on the battery icon, it showed "Battery not Present".  Picture of this attached.  Mind you, I had only received the laptop the day before this.I contacted ASUS by chat, and they had me do some stuff -- screen shot of what I did is attached.  This allowed the battery to charge back up, but exactly the same thing happened again, that is, once the battery ran down, the battery would not charge, and the battery indicated 100% until it ran down.I contacted ASUS again, and this time they had me restore the OS using Windows Recovery - Restore this PC.  This again allowed the battery to charge, but again it indicated 100% until it ran down, then indicated the battery was not present and will not charge.As long as the laptop is connected to the power supply, it works fine.  Very fast, good display, etc.Obviously there is something wrong with it, so I returned it.0 stars for the laptop, but ASUS service was easy to get in touch with and did what they could.  And Amazon made the return very easy.0 stars for Amazon packing.  They just put the box the laptop came in into another box with no packing material except a piece of crumpled up paper.  The box the laptop in was free to bounce around in this box, although it was not damaged that I could see.  I have to wonder if the packing at the Amazon fulfillment center is completely done by robots?  Perhaps the time and money saved is greater than than the shipping damage.', b'Love it. Got it on sale after knowing I\'d not be able to afford a 17" with the graphics I wanted to last for a few years. Excellent screen viewable from all angles and at least 10\' away with colors still looking the same even at 45 degree angle and over 6\' away. Keyboard feels awesome, very tactile with a nice feel to know when you activate a key. Sound is at least average, but I usually use headphones which get plenty loud too. It\'s not filled with bloatware which is a nice surprise, does have software preloaded but it\'s things people might actually use like Office, Polaris Office and some gaming stuff which is reasonable as people are likely to use this for gaming. The build feels solid and there\'s just a fraction of an inch of lift from the bottom when lifting just the lid. I like the arrow keys are shifted down just a bit to make them easier to find/use. Track pad feels really smooth and nice to use, it looks like it doesn\'t have dedicated left/right but it does they are just recessed and surprisingly easy to use and feel great.Not a fan of red back lit keyboard, but red seems to be the color of the moment and you can turn it off, which is great in a lit area otherwise you better know where your keys are. My one complaint is there\'s no End key outside of the one on the Numberpad with Num Lock off. I use it a lot in both typing and spreadsheets to get around with just the keyboard. There is still the End on the Num pad, but that\'s Num Lock off, End, Num Lock on (to avoid future errors especially which spreadsheets). Also doesn\'t have Page Up/Down buttons except on the Num Pad.']}

My friend said Lenovo was a good company - more rubbish - I did a search for information on wifi issues and Lenovo and there are lots of pages about how this has been their issue for years - yes they give you some things to try to see if they help, but why can't they fix the problem before they ship the computers to retailers - WHY is it still a problem years later that must be fixed by the buyer!!!! Not good enough.  I even bought a realtec wifi extender and had to send it back because the computer wouldn't install it and gave me a message that it is not supported by this computer.  The computer I am typing this on has an extender, it is 10 years old and as I watch the signal bars on the new computer fluctuate, they don't move at all on this computer. My 6 year old 11 inch HP doesn't have a signal problem. I wasted my money buying this.", b'Its decent. Worth the money. Could have had a better quality for the price but its adequate.  Its a bit slow/glitchy when opening certain apps or windows which can be annoying but fast enough to do what i need it to with no major problems. I like the look as a whole and like the feel of the keyboard for the price. Dont like the feel of the mousepad or the mousepads left and right click. They suck. But i use a seperate mouse so no biggy. Its relatively quiet but not all the time. Battery life isnt as great as expected but its good enough for the price i suppose. Its lightwieght for its size so thats good. I like most everything about it but i dont love it. Id change a few things and add about 50 bucks to the price but thats just a personal preference/opinion. As far a laptops go, its a good computer for a price that wont break you. It does what i need it to do, and then some, with minor annoyances here and there but not to the point of it being something that would cause me to not recommend it. If you can find better for the same price or maybe just a little pricier, go for it. Im just glad to have a modern, working pc. Thanks.', b"Bought this for my ten year old for school and creating.

I have an Alienware gaming laptop. There are two reasons I wanted this desk. One, I am on my computer a lot during the day whether for school work, watching videos, and/or playing video games. Two, my laptop gets uncomfortable sitting on my lap for long periods of time because it gets hot and for gaming it is not suitable to not be at a desk when playing when in need of a mouse or such.DURABILITY:I find this desk very durable. You can adjust all three parts of the legs to different degrees to have it sit comfortably however you need it to be. I love this feature. With gaming, watching video, and even writing an essay it is hard to sit at an actual desk for so long without feeling uncomfortable or getting back pain from sitting up right in a chair for so long. Again, one of the main reasons I wanted this desk was for the comfort aspect.  I am more motivated when I can sit where I want to sit and creatively write a paper.The next thing I absolutely adore would be the mouse pad extension. I love using a mouse at all times, but sometimes when you want to sit on the couch there is no possible way that a mouse will work with you. This gives you the solution to this exact problem. No matter how you adjust the desk to sit, you can put the mouse extension on comfortably to fit your needs.It is made out of some sort of soft metal or very hard plastic (the base). I have had no problems with this whatsoever. It does not bend at all with my heavy laptop on it. I have even used a cooling pad AND my laptop on top of it and it holds up great. I haven't found an adjustment that has not worked with my laptop and the way I am sitting.Basically in the end, if you are an avid laptop user this is the desk for you. There a lot of other desks out there that are stationary but none as revolutionary as this when it comes to comfort and use.I will even go so far as to say even if you are not using a laptop and you are reading a book, kindle, writing, drawing, eating even... It is a desk that makes all of this comfortable on any surface!", b'The laptop space is perfect. Great size great everything. Love how it extends in so many ways making it super versatile for just about anywhere.However, the most important piece (to me at least) is the mousepad area portion.For starters, the rubberized grip piece that holds the mousepad on the leg, was not put on straight the moment I opened the box. It was crooked. After about 10-15 uses, the rubber pad came off entirely. Now the mouse pad slides up and down the leg freely with ease even when tightened as much as possible.Second. Even when it had the rubberized grip piece, the mousepad tilted. It\xe2\x80\x99s extremly hard to tighten down all the way due to poor placement of the knob to tighten it with. It is directly under the mouse pad area, it should have been placed on the outside of it (yes I have tried setting it up on the outside, very clearly not meant to be that way)Third, the mouse pad tilts. Even when you get the thing tightened all the way, the \xe2\x80\x9cteeth\xe2\x80\x9d on the metal bracket connecting to the actual mouse pad piece are spaced out way to much. There more teeth than there are slots so it kind of glides. It may only move a couple degrees, but with the couple degrees, comes your mouse sliding off and falling down to whatever is below. Making it so you have to hold the mouse the whole time you use this thing.Looking to find a better product because these flaws are in the design, not something customer service can fix.', b"I bought this to put on my desk so I could stand up and do my work instead of sitting in a chair all day. I also found it to be useful as a lap tray since it's raised and I'm not bending my head forward so much. The mouse attachment is very handy. Definitely a win-win.", b"I just received this today.  Other than that i couldn't find anything to explain how to attach the mouse pad or what the 2 extra pieces of plastic were for, it was fairly easy to make useful.  It is a little cumbersome at first to get it to be level and get both sides the same.  The measurement angle things on the buttons do not match so even if i set them exactly the same it was lopsided.  Just so yiu know, the 2 pieces of plastic appear to be extenders for the lip that holds the laptop so yu slide them onto tha.  Also, i didn't put the mouse part on correctly since there were no instructions fro that, but will adjust per this picture later.  I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the incompletei nstructions and diffiuclty getting set-up initially.  I think it iwll work well for me because i work from home and often in my bed due to a back injury and the laptop was getting too hot in my lap so this will help to get it off from me.", b"Great stand for bedtime reading or working on a tablet or other mobile device.  I got it for my fayher, who is bed bound, and this allows him to read without having to hold a heavy tablet or book (and keeps the page stable, unlike when he's holding it in his hand).  The stand is infinitely configurable into almost any angle or position.  My only complaint is that it took 10-15 minutes to get up the learning curve for adjusting it's shape and position.  It's actually very easy once you have played with it (each joint -- there are three on each side - has a button to push that unlocks just that joint and allows it to rotate to the next locked position).But if you've never had one of these, it was very frustrating at first to adjust it, and finally think it was correct...only to disocover when setting it down that it was uneven because the two sides' joints were not set symmetrical).  As my father sat there watching me struggle to get it right, he started thinking it wasn't something he wanted (but he changed his mind later after he saw how great it was to use).  Ultimately, I still recommend this highly, and once you have it figured out, it's a breeze to adjust....but just be prepared to fiddle with it for a while when you first get it, rather than using it immediately out of the box."]}

The second one is taken two months later, and I recommend you follow the recent review in comparison. Originally rated 4 stars, now 3.***This the ASUS VivoBook Flip 14 m3-7Y30.Ok, let\'s start out with the minor faults I have found:For the 14 inch m3, there is no backlit keyboard, no finger sensor, and you are not sent the pen. I feel like Amazon made this very misleading and I find that to be very unfortunate. There are a few different version of this laptop, but I think it\'s best to differentiate which laptop has these certain perks, and to not advertise like it has all of them. I was really looking forward to the backlit keyboard but like I said, it doesn\'t come on this one.But aside from that, I am so far really enjoying this laptop. It\'s really beautiful, thin, and light, and I know this will perfectly fit in my backpack without straining my shoulders. The screen is a great size for watching TV shows, movies, and any YouTube video, and I think that will come in really handy. Asus did a superior job with making the bezels much thinner, and it really shows. Ontop of that, the audio is stellar, and I am blown away at the power of the sound that this little thing has! The bass can be heard extremely well, and the speakers on both the left and right sides are rich and full. I\'ve never heard better audio on any laptop before. Finally, the laptop seems to run quite smooth and quick, even when I\'ve got about six or seven tabs open when doing schoolwork. Starting up does not take long either. In terms of the glare, I honestly don\'t think it\'s terrible, but if you focus on it, of course it will be noticeable. I don\'t think it\'s that bad, and I still think the images appear nicely. Yes, 100% brightness on this type of laptop may not be as bright on either a Mac or even a Samsung Chromebook, but I don\'t mind since my eyes strain easily from a screen that is too bright. That being said though, viewing in intensely sunny places may not be the best idea. The keyboard types nicely and the touch pad is very smooth. One thing I noticed about Asus laptops from YouTube reviews is that the keyboard is very bouncy, but it is rather firm on here and there is no bounce at all. Touch screen works fine, but lags occasionally here and there. I don\'t know if it\'s because it\'s new, but even when using the touch screen, the screen is still very clean. I\'d finally like to add that it is a very silent laptop, and it did heat up while charging, but after removing it, it was fine. Speaking of the charger, it\'s very convenient since it\'s small and compact.Overall this is quite the fine laptop for the price, and it\'s certainly a looker. I only wish that Asus would make laptops that have all of this plus the backlit keyboard in the same price range. I will update my review after a few months or if I find anything wrong with the laptop. For now I recommend this for any student who wants a laptop that can be used for school and entertainment. Also, this is one of the nicest looking laptops out there for a great price. Excited to see what else Asus has to offer, and I really hope they can continue expanding!***2 Months Later*** - 1 Star due to underperforming battery life and pad lagging.  The main perk of this laptop is how easily you can move with it. It\'s light and compact, and that\'s a huge must for me as a college student walking along campus. The performance hasn\'t lagged, but I do have issues with the the touch pad (the thing you use for the mouse? Not the screen)  being slow and randomly spazing out. Also the dark glare has become bothersome but can I really complain that much? I\'m still bothered that Amazon hasn\'t fixed the description of this product, because I still long for the back lit keyboard when it gets dark, but again, it\'s a very minor thing that shouldn\'t drop a star from the door star rating. If there\'s one thing that should is the battery life. I\'m kind of getting tired of technology telling us about this great battery life we\'re getting, when after doing actual work, we really aren\'t. Of course I have many tabs open when I work and I will watch YouTube or listen to Spotify, but I still feel like the life could be a lot better than what was advertised. I am pretty sure that I am not the only student who has various tabs/programs open. Concerning the 360 ability of the laptop... I really don\'t use it. Just to show people "hey look!" and that\'s it. If they charge more for that, that\'s really ridiculous. I don\'t use the touch screen too much since I\'m not a fan of dirtying my screen, but I suppose it can be helpful when the pad lags. I will say that a good thing about this laptop is that it doesn\'t take long at all to turn on and the speakers. I\'m still highly impressed by these speakers. But with that being said, I\'m not sure if I\'m going to buy another Asus laptop after this. If you\'re on a budget I recommend getting this for now, but if you can splurge on something pricier that has better performance then go ahead. It\'s crazy to say that $600 isn\'t a lot for a laptop, because if you ask me, that\'s barely how much I make in a month working part time while going to school full time... While technology has graced us, it has also burdoned us with high costs for an ultimately subpar performance. Unfortunately what can we do? It\'s a practical necessity as a student to have a stable computer that does x y and z. Nevertheless, I still hope that Asus will continue to improve their products. For now, this is an aesthetically pleasing and compact laptop that performs at a slightly above average performance with some cons that greatly bring it down.', b"After much research my wife and I purchased 2 refurbished units. 2 pc for under 500.00? What a great deal right? Well it is a great deal and a great pc!! We both are very happy with the purchase, performance and overall win with this pc. We were both looking for a 2in1 with windows os. It can handle multiple tabs open and does not slow down. The case could be a little more robust, but it's good for someone who is careful. I don't think it would handle too many drops. Overall, another great Asus product at a great price. Edit: don\xe2\x80\x99t miss out on the Realtech audio settings, go in and adjust and trying different sounds themes. The sounds volume and quality are quite impressive, just another bonus!!", b"Very thin amazing look. the color isn't shiny nor matte just brilliant. This model does not come with the Asus stylus pen which is the only con I had to purchase separately around $50. but the price for this is great. Aside from no stylus included worth the money for such an awesome laptop. Bravo Asus and Amazon!!", b"This laptop really performs well for the price and is a better option for me vs. Chromebooks in a similar price range as it also of  course runs full windows apps. I've read some negative reviews concerning the screen but I'm guess they must be referring to the HD version (1366x768) and not this Full HD version (1920x1080 ie. 1080p). The screen looks very decent and I'm very happy with performance of the m3 proccessor. It's also a great looking machine, feels very well made. In my opinion, the look and feel reminds me of the new Macbook Pros, at a fraction of the cost.The only 2 gripes I have are that the keyboard isn't backlit, and that I can't charge the laptop via USB-C, like with the Asus Chromebook C302CA, for example, but I still prefer the bigger screen (14 vs. 12.5 inches) and just purchased an extra power adapter so that I can leave one at home and one at work.Edit: I forgot to mention that in flip/tent or tablet mode, you can of course type right on the touch-screen in the dark, regardless of the non-backlit keyboard, and it also includes a stylus if you want to avoid fingerprints on the screen!", b'I bought this laptop because my iPad got stolen and figured why not just try a laptop to be able to type excel sheets and do basic office stuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool how it turns into a tablet. The screen is big and you can\xe2\x80\x99t beat the price', b'Wifi connectivity issues. Does not reset to default.

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

Go ahead and get it just bear in mind it needs a little work right out of the box.', b'Beautiful screen 17", only deficit is that it runs Windows 10. Windows 10 has a LOT of bloatware~ things you will never use. So once removed, the machine will be even faster, and you will have more storage for your stuff. At first we thought the computer was broken, because it wouldn\'t turn on, in actuality, the electrical surge protector strip was malfunctioning. Good to know. This is an outstanding deal. I do graphics and write. Perfect for both.', b'For an entry level, budget priced, 17" screen basic laptop, I think 4/5 is warranted!  You are not paying for an Intel core i7 or tons of memory or a 6 cell battery or a solid state drive so just go in with eyes wide open, this platform is not a speed demon.  Honestly the biggest thing holding it back is the slow, old school, HDD which is a 1TB but just inching along at 5,400 rpm.  Software updates to the OS, installing new software, and even launching applications this thing takes its time.  Sometimes when double-clicking to launch Office apps, the 1-2 second delay makes you want to double-click again.  If you\'re a very patient person, you\'ll probably find this machine good enough for the money spent.Now... let me tell you what I did.  This is a budget refresh for my 70+ year old parents with a 7-8 year old HP Pavilion which I\'d already upgraded once.  I\'m a tech geek by profession so I can\'t leave good enough alone... it\'s not a simple task but this machine is upgradable.  I pulled out the HDD and replaced it with a 2.5" Sandisk 480GB SSD, upgraded to a 16GB Ram kit (2 - 8GB sticks), and loaded a fresh copy of Windows 10 Home on this thing.  WOW what a major improvement.  The bottlenecks in this laptop are not the CPU, controller, display, or integrated video... its really about putting in a quality SSD and maybe a RAM upgrade and you can be running W10 like a speed demon.  Of course, these upgraded will set you back ~$300 so... maybe the smart play is to just get that $650-$750 unit that\'s already hooked up with these upgraded to begin with!  But what fun would that be...', b'This is a good laptop i had to replace my old hp cuz it died on me and this one does the job just fine and for the price its a great deal', b'bought computer for my wife for Christmas. spent hours updating with newest version of windows.  then after a week or so had to completely start all over again . then abut 2 weeks ago computer failed again spent hours doing it again . Then today wife tried to start computer and after Hp window informing her that it didnt start right and would reboot after a couple of times doing this . I said to hell with this worthless piece of trash.Sending back for refund.']}

Her experience ranged from managing financial and legal service companies to becoming President and General Counsel of a Business and Industrial Development Corporation. Kelly C. Sturmthal, Esq. is an attorney licensed in Florida. Her background was in banking and worked for law firms focusing on Estate Planning, Real Estate, and Commercial Litigation. Together Catherine and Kelly founded Sturmthal & Hodder, PA., a Mobile Law Practice, in Florida. Their practice focused on Estate Planning and Business Planning. Their successful practice was highlighted in The Palm Beach Post. They also have launched www.GoSoloForSuccess.com which provides inspiration, advice and support for solo practitioners and entrepreneurs. Find them at www.GoSoloForSuccess.com.', b'"Law Office on a Laptop: How to Set Up Your Own Successful Mobile Law Practice is a truly comprehensive yet accessible guide to going solo. The new second edition adds valuable resources and considerations on social media and online presence that was absent from the first edition - which is more important and relevant now than it ever has been. Hodder and Sturmthal adequately prepare any lawyer or recent law school grad to gather the tools and build their own practice. This is a must read for anyone thinking of going solo or anyone who has recently taken the leap to go solo. Five stars."', b'As others have said, this is a good general guide for starting a law practice. It has lots of creative marketing, networking, and client generation ideas, but less information than I had hoped about the tech side of setting up a mobile practice. I got the paper version, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t do a word search, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the word \xe2\x80\x9claptop\xe2\x80\x9d actually appeared in the book at all. Being literal is an occupational hazard in the legal profession, but I was looking for more specifics about the kinds of hardware and software needed to operate a mobile office, what worked and what didn\xe2\x80\x99t, what is cost effective and what\xe2\x80\x99s not, etc. Still, it provided good ideas, ample food for thought, and great examples of creative problem solving and out of the box thinking. All in all, a worthwhile read.', b"A great read for lawyers contemplating a mobile practice, what I'd call location-free. The authors cover all the basics in a thoughtful, encouraging style as well as offer digital resources. I enjoyed the conversational tone and stories. The book is a good repository of the information you need. I wish it offered more strategy and step-by-step guidance.", b'This book opened my eyes to realizing my dream of starting my own solo. I am a transactional attorney. Why not go to the client and save on the rent as I am just starting out?', b'I was already thinking about taking my law practice mobile, and after reading the book I am more committed than ever.  The information was direct and to the point on how to set up your law practice to be successful with I like to call "location independent" practice of law.  You won\'t be disappointed.', b'I highly recommend Law Office on a Laptop! I am in my third year on my own and this really breathed fresh air into my efforts for my solo practice! Thank you! I got the digital copy, but since I found myself bookmarking a few pages, I will be ordering a hard copy for returning references! Easy read, but really meaty!', b'Short and sweet.  Somewhat basic, but provides good advice for start ups.  Good advice on credit card vendors.', b'It was okay. A good refresher. I guess I was expecting more detail about different areas of being a virtual law firm.']}

For the price, I could not find a better value out there and I shopped around about 3 months. The processor is fast, there is a ton of RAM and a 1TB hard drive. I absolutely love it and have zero complaints. This is more than enough for the average and average + user. The free backpack has tons of padded pockets and zipper compartments. Highly recommend this set.", b"I'm using it as I write this review.  The screen is a little smaller than the previous HP that I gave to my wife although I was only one year old.  The New HP Bisiness Laptop is very fast, clear screen and plenty of space for my business.  I'm very pleased with quality I have received in my HP Laptops and would recommend them without reservation.", b"This laptop is a lot more powerful and useful than others seem to think - either they got it from faulty sellers or somehow the postage roughed theirs up, because it's a little beast for its price. 12 GB of RAM and a TB of space for only $500 is an amazing steal, and the fact that it has a quad-core processor and radeon graphics isn't anything to sneeze at either. This is the kind of little machine you'd get from your friend who works at HP who offers to build you a computer for $500, only it's straight from HP itself for the same price.I manage to play games with their highest settings that I couldn't on my old laptop, all while I have memory hogs like Chrome and Discord open in the background, and it's absolutely stunning.Plus, it comes with a nice mouse and a well-made backpack, both of which I get just as much use from as the laptop itself.", b'I bought this laptop for my 7-year-old nephew.  He really wanted to play Minecraft on a laptop after he attended Minecraft camp.  Came to find out that "regular" laptops don\'t support Minecraft due to the graphics.  Best Buy told me I would have to buy a gaming laptop between $800 to $1,000.  I asked my friend whose son builds computers and he found this and it works perfectly for what I want.  Minecraft downloaded easily and works great, there is room for more games to be downloaded, it is touch screen and, because he takes care of his stuff, this laptop will last him for years.  It also came with a mouse and a backpack.  I am pleasantly surprised and would highly recommend this computer.', b'It is fast, It is touch screen and it is a great deal. The seller did do a poor job of listing this item due to left out details. Once you get it you can look it up.  It is a real HP pavilion laptop. It does not run too hot. I am able to watch movies, play online games and do my work on this laptop. I do know computers very well and no this will not run graphics intense games that require a dedicated graphics card. Nor should you expect it to at this price point. The battery is removable so you can buy an extra  or upgrade it if it becomes a concern. Keys are crisp. Mouse pad is above average and the touch screen is just a crazy added bonus at this price. I have been using it for about a month without issue.', b"As with many HP products on Amazon.com, this one comes defective out of the box.Only 5 days old and it has stuck pixels on the screen.Stuck Pixels are ACTIVATED PIXELS that only show one colour: red, blue, green, white. If it is black then it is called a Dead pixel.Stuck pixels are easily noticeable on black or dark backgrounds/wallpapersFor anyone wondering: I rarely use the touch screen feature, PC has only been on for a considerable length of time during updates and the screen turns off during that time.I contacted HP, they suggested I return it to Amazon for a replacement, but Amazon doesn't accept replacement of this PC nor do they offer Tech Support.So am stuck combating HP tech support who want to distance themselves from the product. 2 hours and counting and still waiting for my warranty to be enforced.Therefore buy from 3rd party sellers at your own risk. (I already asked this seller about my warranty. will update about response)My first HP laptop from amazon suffered from:- WIFI failure before 6 monthsFIX:  Use USB tether through cell phone- Screen Failure around 9 monthsFIX: Use external monitor-  Keyboard failure at about 2 yearsFIX: Use external KeyboardBut this Laptop is for work, I just cant be lugging around a monitor whenever I need to use it.", b'This is a really great laptop.  Plenty of power to do what you want it to do, can even play some games on here.  I use mine for light gaming and graphic design.  One thing I dont like about this is the battery life.  Apparently its only a 3 cell battery and I have noticed I might get one, maybe two hours on a full charge and thats just basic use nothing intensive or taxing.  Other than that you cant beat this for the price!', b'Arrived quickly, had a scratch on the case (aesthetics don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me, but concerned about handling). Does not have Bluetooth connectivity (at least the one I got does not), which is frustrating; you have to purchase an adapter. Really fast. My biggest concern is that the box lists the RAM as 8GB, yet has 12GB, so I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming extra RAM was added. I\xe2\x80\x99m not complaining about the 12GB RAM, but it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a sketchy bc I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the legitimacy of the installer, manufacturer, etc. My number one biggest concern is the wireless network adapter which stopped working less than a month after purchase. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried all the troubleshooting I can, and my conclusion is maybe hardware failure. Really sucks but I\xe2\x80\x99ll purchase an external network adapter and I can still connect via Ethernet. Overall, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic deal for a decent computer and cool accessories. Will post update if network adapter issue changes.UPDATE 4/2/18:I promise it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an April Fool\xe2\x80\x99s joke, but next day upon reboot my network adapter was working properly. Hopefully continues to work!!! Added one star.']}

Drawers opened and closed smoothly. This stand fit my needs perfectly, providing height and storage economically.  With risers, height was ~ 4 1/8"; without, 2.5.', b"This product works, but isn't the best quality. The drawers don't seem to line up right and are difficult to open. Also, some of the pieces almost seem disconnected from each other and the legs bend easily... it would probably be easy to pull the whole thing apart. The materials just seem cheap, but I guess that's to be expected considering it's the cheapest one I could find (still not sure why these are ever more that $10). It does work for what I want it for and I will be keeping it for sure, but if you're looking for durability and a nicer-looking stand, maybe go for a more expensive one.", b"Super-duper flimsy, thin, bends with even laptop weight, and then I can't open the center drawer.  It doesn't have enough weight enough to stay in place, plus the little feet don't stay in, which makes it really difficult to use as a touch screen loptop stand/ergonomic lift (I have a wireless keyboard, so there isn't much movement).It's a cool design, layout, just wished they constructed it with a bit more heartiness.  After I glued the feet, distributed the weight with a stand, and have a non-slip liner under the feet I can use it, but I gave up using the drawers, they stick and then all the little things inside get messed up.", b'I do not use this as a monitor stand. I bought 4 of these to use to store my vaping equipment and supplies. They fit under my 11" x 11" vape stand and stack nicely. The drawers have molded in dividers which makes the storage a bit more challenging, but still acceptable, because some items will only fit in certain spaces.  I knocked off one star because the drawers do not close 100% due to the weight of the vape stand (last 1/8th inch of travel).  I doubt they would close 100% if a monitor was on top. The drawers do open and close just fine though with no binding. I did not use the included legs. I got two to start with then two more. I recommend them for storage uses similar to my needs.', b"I Really Like This Item As Neat Stuff Like This Really Fits The Bill.Basically I bought this as I needed more storage on my Work/Desk Area and also as usual 'The Price' is right!.Its also a free Bonus as you can use this to change the height/elevation of your monitor.So mine fills both worlds as in height its also perfect for me, Now Super Tall people may want to use a pad or similar item to go higher.But others may wish to remove the feet to bring it down a bit lower if that works better for you.In truth I -really needed- a bigger desk but being a bit older plus I tend to move a lot so I am trying to get away from big and heavy furniture.Now I have mine set up with the Monitor slid back to provide a small work surface for notepads, Pens and my Watch.And right underneath as you see I have the 3 drawers and tho you cant see it well in the photos there is still a small area under the feet where you can slide envelopes and other small but necessary items, Or everything a 'Busy 21st Century Executive' needs in a work station!.Once again 'Hats Off' to Amazon for selling a really useful item and also at a very good price!.So buy and enjoy: IndianaED", b"It's hard, thin plastic.  If I didn't have a mouse pad the size of my desk as protection, I do not think I would have bought this unit for fear that even pulling the drawers out on this thing would scratch the desk, and there aren't any soft bumpers on the rest of it either.  The lack of bumpers knocked off a star.I do have that gigantic mouse pad though, so it's okay.  It's great, actually.  It doesn't look chintzy.  It is sturdy enough to raise up my all-on-one PC so I'm ergonomically in check and I have what I need inside the little drawers instead of all over the place so it looks nice and tidy, aside from my coffee, etc.  That said, because my computer is raised, it's protected from the coffee too.  How great is that?  Full on double rainbow amazing... nah, it's not that great but it is everything I need in terms of looks and function.For the price, it's a great buy.", b"This thing is great, man. I bought it for my desk at work and it's made my life SO much easier. People always compliment how nice/organized my desk is when they come to my desk. Holds/organizes enough for any general desk job. I like that I could have it propped up high with the legs attached or take the legs off to keep it low/neutral. The drawers open and close nicely and the plastic seems pretty durable. I hide candy in the back of the far left drawer ;)", b"This helped me organize my office desk wonderfully. It has a very heavy monitor sitting on top of it and it is not bending under the weight at all. I can open and close all drawers still with ease. Fits all standard offices supplies and things I don't want just rolling around on my desk including pens, highlighters, post its, extra wires for head phones, etc. I even still had room for gum, lotion, and breath mints. Not too bad."]}

Some quick points -1. The screen is underwhelming- It is a TN display (and not IPS), which means that  colors look washed out if the display isn\'t in the most "optimal" position.- The screen is pretty glossy. Need to crank the brightness up just to hide the annoying reflections- The resolution is too low.  This is especially noticeable when using it in tablet mode, since the screen tends to be closer to the face when doing so,2. The half-sized right shift key is annoying.  I\'m still adapting my typing style to it, even after 2 months of usage.3. The keyboard quality is great.  The feedback, key sizes etc are pretty good.4. No lags or slowdowns in normal usage (office apps, browsing etc) despite it sporting only a Pentium CPU.  Any slowdowns are actually due to the HDD - but even this not bad.', b"This is a great starter laptop for a non-power user. We bought this for my 9 year old daughter to use for school and fun, and it's met those needs well. I wouldn't try to run complicated graphic-intense games on it, but for writing papers and watching annoying YouTube videos, it is just right.", b'This is one of those laptops that does some things very well and frustrates me greatly on other minor aspects. I did think of returning this thing but decided I can live with the flaws, but I guess you be the judge.Let me start with the pros:1) I like the feel of the keyboard; it\'s solid and doesn\'t feel cheap at all.2) For the price, I like the fact that it has a 14" screen, 500gb hard drive, and it\'s less than 4 pounds. Sure beats the other notebooks of its category that use a solid state drive of like only 64gb or 128gb storage capacity. Having 500gb is great because I can store all my music files totaling 200gb and more.3) I like the overall performance with video and audio streaming (with YouTube and Pandora); it is actually excellent.4) Screen color quality is good, no complaints there.Now the cons:1) Whoever designed this keyboard ought to be fired! The right Shift key was halved in width so that what would normally be its left half is the up arrow key instead! I am a touch typist who types 100+wpm, and this bothers me to end. While typing in this review, I had already accidentally pressed the Up arrow key instead of the Shift key about 5 times. Sorry, but I have to say whoever designed and allowed this kind of a keyboard design to get through are clearly not touch typists and are idiots.2) This laptop has a graphics driver issue even with its latest driver. If your wallpaper is not the exact size of the screen resolution, be ready to see your wallpaper occasionally display as all white with tiny gray dots all over. The maximum screen resolution of this laptop is 1377x768. If your wallpaper is like 1920x1080, be ready to see this occasional symptom. It doesn\'t happen all the time, but often enough to annoy you. And when it does happen, your wallpaper will not get restored until the next wallpaper refresh; if you can\'t wait till then, just go to Background in the Settings and it will refresh. But if you use a wallpaper with 1377x768, you will not get this problem.3) Another graphics driver issue is that when using the Google Chrome browser, if the page is heavy with graphics, and you switched to some other application and then back to the browser, expect the client area of the browser to *sometimes* be pitch black. The way to correct this is simply to resize the browser, and the client area will be repainted/refreshed. I am using Google Chrome in like 4 to 5 other computers regularly, never have I ever seen this kind of a problem.I called up Lenovo technical support for this several times, and after downloading the driver, it got stuck at installation. To make a long story short, the tech guy told me to reinstall the reset the operating system to factory conditions, but it didn\'t get rid of the problem.As you can see, the problems are not major, but they\'re extremely annoying. I decided not to return this because of what you get for the price, I got a lightweight notebook with decent storage capacity, something I couldn\'t find without having to settle for an inadequate 64gb or 128gb solid state drive.', b"Buy far the best purchase during the Holiday season...returned 2 other laptops and got this one...it's really fun!  Has a lot of nice features, and it does everything I need it to do...", b'for the money and a dedicated use of excel and windows may be ok - slow to bring up applications and run them - not a good multitasking machine - audio a bit weak ok with headset - screen is vary narrow view and brightness not as good as it should be - again for the $ and my dedicated use OK - if buying again I would still look to Lenovo but a higher end unit with more memory - thinking about designing a boot to cover key pad when folded in the tablet configuration to protect it and provide a good base', b'Perfect laptop for the average college student! Amazing battery life for the cost, decently fast for a computer this price, sleek and not bulky and the touch screen/tablet feature is fun and convenient. The screen is a bit meh and causes glare in a well lit room but other than that its great. Will NOT find a better computer for this price and i have looked at all of them so take my word for it.', b"This is a well-built laptop with many great features and a terrific price - but with only 4GB of RAM and a relatively slow HDD.  Depending on your apps, you may find it is frustratingly slow to become responsive again after waking from sleeping.  I recommend also buying an 8GB DRAM upgrade for about $60.  It completely eliminates the slowdowns and it's still a great price.", b'I am still learning all of the cool tricks this 2 n 1 laptop/tablet has. I did not think this Lenovo could do so much. The screen is super bright and clear, and it sits in about a zillion different positions. The battery life is quite adequate and movie watching is great, especially the Harmon Kardon speakers make the media experience amazing.The touch screen is very responsive and I love having a touchscreen on my tablet. But the best thing about this great computer was its price. It might seem a little heavy but with all of the positions it utilizes the weight does not pose a problem whatsoever.It is a wonderful, useful, very cool computer.']}

I went ahead and checked the internals as well, (not for your average home user), and it was very clean. My particular unit was manufactured in May of 2012, and I am thinking it did not have a lot of mileage to it. It does come with a new clean installation of Windows 7 64 bit Professional, ready to boot up and install. The battery seemed in good shape, and passed the Dell website battery diagnostic test. In addition, while these machines are out of original warranty, (3 years), the Dell website is full of easy to use support options, even offering an extended warranty if you wish to pay for it. A machine like this, refurbished from Dell proper, will run $700 to $800. You might want to read the reviews on the Dell E6420 on the Web, as it is a robust laptop, made for travel and not made of egg shells. Fantastic machine.On the critical side, my unit came with the i5-2410M Intel Sandy Bridge processor, and not the i5-2520, (as advertised), and the i5-2410M is slightly slower, with a base of 2.3 Ghz., and turbo boost (sustained) of 2.8 Ghz. In addition, the 4 GB of RAM, (2 x 2 GB modules), were miss matched in speed, so they were only running at 533 Mhz, and not 667 Mhz. I went ahead and changed them out to new 2 new Corsair RAM modules at 4 GB, for a total of 8 GB dual channel memory, now running at 800 Mhz. I was not crazy about the old Samsung 128 GB SSD that came with the Laptop, so I changed it out to a new Toshiba 256 GB Q Series Pro SSD, and I ran an additional clean install of Windows 7 64 bit Professional. The new RAM and new SSD made a reasonably fast laptop even faster. You can use this laptop for very demanding applications without the computer lagging or slowing down. The only area this laptop might fall short on would be for intensive graphics associated with complex PC games, 3D rendering, or intense video editing. For most business and home applications, this laptop will more then keep up.Keep in mind, that if you need any additional drivers or support, you can get it all at the Dell website. I went ahead and updated the BIOS and  checked for the most up to date drivers off of the Dell website.Also, be prepared to take some time on the first install of Windows 7, that there will be about 200 to 220 updates needed almost immediately once you get the machine up and running and hooked up to the Internet. On the bright side, you did not get a new laptop with a "ton" of stupid bloatware and junk you did not want or need.These Dell Machines do come in slightly different configurations, and are being sold by different secondary vendors. Mine came from TechHarvard, but there are 2 or 3 other vendors selling these as well under this same heading. While I feel very positive about buying this refurbished laptop, and I know I got an excellent value, individual results may vary.Quite frankly, I would buy this machine again, and I would buy this refurbished Dell laptop ahead of most of the new junk that you can find in the Retail stores. If you are on a budget, and you need a great laptop, you could not go wrong buying this unit. If you are not on a budget, go ahead and get the new Dell E6440 laptop, but be prepared to fork over $1,200 or so for the privilege. Trust me, the Dell E6440 is not going to perform much better then this refurbished E6420, and if the new E6440 comes with a standard hard drive instead of an SSD, it will be a slower machine.If in doubt, just buy it.(Edit and Update Jan 2017). I did go ahead and upgrade this Laptop PC to Windows 10 Pro, during the Summer of 2016. I am happy to share that I ran into "Zero" issues with the upgrade, and had no driver issues. Even at this particular time of update, a year and a half after I have purchased this machine, it is still running strong and it is a better value than the Laptops you might get at a Big Box Store. FYI.', b"Excellent Laptop !! As my current laptop stopped working, I have been looking for a replacement. With the help of my IT friends i understood that Dell Latitude 64xx series is a work horse. Very powerful machine. Little skeptical as this is my first refurbished product in any category. But this company didn't disappoint me. They had sent clear notes on how to boot the machine and register. David even sent an email asking if i need any help. I got 6430 even though amazon description says 6420. Very decent configuration. Hard Drive size is less but you cant ask more in $200 laptop. It comes with 1 year warranty, which is a big plus. Booting is very fast as the hard disk is SSD. Able to setup easily and the laptop was up and running in no time. Overall, i believe this is a very good buy and value for money. Hope Blazing Prices could support if there are any issues. Its been 1 week and the review is based on that. I will come back and write more after few months.", b'Certainly meets my expectations as a refurbished computer. I would say it is much closer to "New". Not a single wear mark on the machine anywhere. Performance is more than adequate, and the solid state hard drive is absolutely a huge win for performance. I will be installing an additional 4GB of ram into mine although it performs perfectly with the 4 already installed.Rigged design, feels solid and runs as many applications as I need to at any given point in time.', b"The unit I received was sold by Blazing Prices, and refurbished by Joysystems. Without hesitation, I can say that this is the best value (and quite possibly best performing) notebook I've owned (a MacBook Air among them). With the SSD, this boots into the Windows 10 sign-on screen in 6 seconds (from power off), and just a few more seconds to a fully ready desktop after login. Cosmetically, though not in brand new condition, it's in extremely good condition. The only places where there are a few minor scratches, are spots you'll never see. Two thumbs up to Joysystems for the refurbishing job, and Blazing Prices for the good deal.", b"For the price, this is an awesome deal. My refurbished laptop arrived looking and running like brand new. In fact, It's considerably faster than the $800 laptop it replaced. It's missing a couple of features than would have been nice (side numbers and a webcam) but the webcam is pretty much a luxury anyway, and I have one on another laptop. The reason I bought this was that I had previously bought one for my daughter to start college with, and I was so impressed with that one that I purchased a second one. It's a workhorse of a computer and takes all that I can throw at is as a web developer and graphic designer. In fact, I'm sick that I spent $1250 on a new Toshiba back in January when this one performs just as well. I noticed that some other reviews stated problems with some sellers and units that came in with different specs than advertised. I was lucky in that mine's exactly as advertised. Providing you don't have those problems, I can't recommend this laptop highly enough.Dell Latitude E6420 Premium-Built 14.1-Inch Business Laptop (Intel Core i5 2.5GHz with 3.2G Turbo Frequency, 4G RAM, 128G SSD, Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, Certified Refurbished)"]}

Then without any warning, they want another $137 warranty -- not forever, but only for ONE YEAR! That means in 3 years, I could have paid for a whole new HP!  No Way!

Please continue reading:I was eyeing this laptop for several weeks now. I was hoping to get a good Black Friday or holiday deal on this item but that time never came so I bit the bullet and got it for $199 (which is reasonable).At first glance, this is quite a small laptop. I\xe2\x80\x99ve used 11.6\xe2\x80\x9d laptops before but with the thinness and weight, I was somewhat surprised by the size and worried that the keyboard would be hard to type on. It did take about two hours of consistent typing for me to get used to this thing. I type a lot of research papers and this is one of the more responsive keyboard laptops I\xe2\x80\x99ve used. Of course, not macbook quality but definitely better than the other budget laptops on the market. Compared to my 13.3\xe2\x80\x9d ASUS chromebook, the keys on this model are more cramped together and smaller in size. However, it is surprisingly nicer to type on and isn\xe2\x80\x99t mushy like the former.As far as battery life goes, I started at 100% estimated usage time of 12hrs. I did a full update, streamed 30mins of video, played 2hrs of pandora, downloaded a bunch of apps and installed google chrome. After all of that, and approximately 3hours later, I still have 62% battery left. I imagine that it will live up to the advertised battery life with normal use. At most, the laptop has gotten slightly warm, not enough to bother anyone should you choose to to use it on your lap though.Memory and performance. OK, this is largely the reason why I was wary of purchasing this laptop. It comes with minimal storage. After all the updates, I was left with 16gb of SSD. I did purchase a 64gb micro sd card for this laptop and all it took was changing storage preferences to get everything directed to the SD card. I did experience some trouble at first as the storage settings did not save for some reason and I had to redirect everything to the micro SD twice. It appears to be working properly now though and apps download relatively fast on this thing. I currently have 16 tabs open on Google Chrome (yes, I am that person) and everything is still running smoothly. The only lag that I\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced was using the Edge on this machine. Do NOT use edge! Just download google chrome and save yourself the trouble.Display and Build quality: Again, this is a very thin and lightweight laptop made out of entirely plastic,  so it feels somewhat cheap. But I think the design and aesthetics may make up for that. At a glance, it looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s made out of aluminum. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into what color it is, as it varies depending on the lighting. But it appears to be a more expensive product than it really is. The screen itself is actually pretty nice for the price. It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stream HD videos well but it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not an eyesore either. Another thing I should point out is that the black bezel on the screen is indeed plastic. (For some reason I thought it was going to be glass.) As far as ports go, all of them are in working order. I did have trouble with the USB 2.0 port as it was rather snug which made inputting and removing USBs rather difficult and with excessive force, unfortunately. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if this will be a long term issue or if it will fail on me in the long run but I\xe2\x80\x99m optimistic.Overall, this is a nice inexpensive laptop that will exceed expectations for anyone simply needing a laptop for essay-typing, web-browsing, and light weight tasks. It is extremely portable and is a great option for people looking to travel with a laptop. For the price and performance, it's worth it.", b'OK, so I was eyeballing this laptop for 2 weeks. Each time I wanted to order it the stock/shipping option on Amazon was not very appealing. However, I guess I got lucky, and I ordered it on Saturday 10/15/2016 (when was in stock) and received this laptop today 10/18/2016.Pros (for me) :- lightweight- good battery life- good speakers- good travel size- good for watching movies and web browsing- Windows 10 64 bit , 4 GB RAM, microSD port, fast A/C WiFi- casting videos to smart TVCons: (based on my opinion)- Hard drive is small -  usable space is around 14 GB, 64GB would be perfect;  but, this one is not a biggest issue for me - 128GB micro-SD card or USB are cheap.- USB ports only 2 - additional USB 3.0 port would be awesome.Bottom line :For $199 it is a pretty good laptop for basic computing i.e watching videos, playing music, web browsing, and basic office/college tasks.Not sure about gaming.', b"Great little computer for writing papers, browsing the web, and watching videos. Very convenient for college students and travelers because the size and weight. I'm satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a computer for using Microsoft products, YouTube, social media and light gaming.", b'This review is specifically for the 14" L402-WA-EH21.First off, a little bit of background: I am a computer person. I build, rebuild, and maintain computers both in professional and personal life.The Good Things-This computer is light weight, easy to use, feels good to type on, and starts fairly quick. Everything about this PC is built specifically to be lightweight and slim. It is specifically built to do web browsing, emailing, instant messaging, and lightweight document creation. Think of it like a Chromebook but running windows. Youtube videos run smooth, network (while n compatible, ac-based) is wifi is zippy but wired is faster, and the screen is bright and vivid (with the right settings). If you are student that needs a budget document creation tool, this will do it. If you need a computer to quickly look up information, close and toss around the living room, or send emails to grandma; this machine will do it.It also has a 2.5" harddrive bay in a cover under the bottom of the laptop (not advertised but it\'s there). I have installed (and highly recommend) a 250gb ssd for the additional storage space (and if you are going to be doing any type of heavy document creation, you will need the space). It works fine without reducing battery life.At the moment, the longest I have used it was 3 hours before plugging it in, but that was because I was leaving for several hours. probably would have made 4 before having to plug it in.The Not-So-Good Things-The L402WA-EH21 has no documentation online, has no specs listed through the ASUS website, and apparently doesn\'t exist other than it is listed on Amazon for sale. The closest model is the E402WA on the ASUS site and comes in two different versions (i think the E is Intel based, the L is AMD based). Given that you are considering purchasing this laptop, all the documentation that you will have will come in the box; a basic start up manual, a warranty card, a small bag of screws (for the harddrive expansion bay), and a power supply.The Bad Things-I received this laptop and plugged it in and fired it up. Standard Windows set up and logged into the desktop. Always first thing to do is to check that Windows activated itself properly. It did not. Alright, so I thought there might be a problem with the OS that was installed on it, so I restored the system using the builtin restoration partition (takes about 45 minutes). I redid the Windows set up, and waited. Same information was stored in the restoration partition as was in the original install. Windows wouldn\'t activate.Alright, being a computer guy, I dug out the tools and scanned the keys that were installed from Asus. The version of Windows installed was 10Home, the key installed through BiOS/UEIF was a 10RTMCore, and had an origin key of 10RTMCloud. All three of these keys are for different versions, none of which are interchangeable with each-other.If you research the OS that is suppose to be installed on this computer (Windows 10S) you will find that it is identical and interchangeable with W 10Pro. Being a  computer guy, I wiped the boot drive and installed Windows 10Pro from a flash drive (takes about 45 mins), did the Windows set up, had the OS pull the key from BiOS ... Windows not active...!At this point I was at a loss as what to do. I did a few activation tricks and called Microsoft Activation to see if i could manually activate Windows 10Pro. Talking to a Third Tier Tech (first two were impatient and useless, about 45 minutes being bounced around), the Tech checked the three keys that I had. The W 10H key was already registered and in use (so dead), and the W 10RTMCore and 10RTMCloud had not called home properly. YES! Two keys were available, one of them was no longer viable. Here\'s the nail in the coffin, I asked the Tech where I could get a ISO (the installer disk) for Windows 10 S (10RTMCloud). His exact answer "Unfortunately, there is no way for you to get ahold of a 10S ISO image. They are distributed directly to manufacturers only." ... Great... Just great...So... After all of that I had a brand new key, a new laptop, and no way to put the OS on it that it was suppose to be installed! Mind you, this is five hours into taking it out of the box. I finally was just about to throw it back in and ship it back when I decided to dig around in Google.So... after about an hour, I found a fix. It\'s complicated, it\'s doable if you are moderately computer savvy, and have about two hours of time; no software needed to be stolen or borrowed from illegitimate sources or anything.1. Get a Windows 10Pro image set and ready on a flashdrive and bootable.2. Install 10 Pro onto the laptop WITHOUT changing any partition information (simply delete the OS partition and stall Windows 10Pro in its place) and bypass the key entry section during install.3. Once the computer is set up and running at the desktop, check to see if the key has Activated. IF IT HAS YOU ARE FINISHED. If not, continue.4. If Windows 10Pro did not activate, you need to find the installer for W 10S. You cannot obtain an ISO, you must use an \'Upgrade\' like installer. The webpage to search for is "Test Windows 10 S on existing Windows 10 education devices". Read most of the page so you know what you\'re getting into, and download the installer.5. Run the installer. It will do an \'Upgrade\' install, move all of the associated profile information to a Windows.old folder on the C drive, and install Windows 10S.6. Alright, you\'ve done this step before. Go through the Windows 10 set up.7. Once you get to the desktop, check to see if Windows 10S has been activated. At this point, Windows 10 pulled the key from the BiOS/UEIF and registered properly!8a. At this point you are ready to run. Go ahead and use the laptop as you want. You will need to run DiskCleanup as administrator to wipe out the Windows 10Pro files that are completely useless and just taking up the tiny storage.8b.If you plan on installing any software that is not Windows 10S verified (through the Windows Store) to be lightweight, this laptop HAS the ability to be upgraded to pro through the Store. Search for \'Upgrade to Pro\'. It will upgrade you straight away without installing anything else. Everything that Windows 10Pro needs is already in 10S, anything that isn\'t will need to be downloaded and installed (which if you need them, you will know where to find them in Programs & Features through the Control Panel).Final Thoughts-Generally, I like this lightweight system. It does exactly what I need it to do; run several messengers, word processing, quick internet searches, basic presentations, and occasionally watching Twitch. If you need a small computer, this will do the trick! If you need something to run Photoshop, you will need something more powerful. If this system had of been manufactured with the proper OS on it at the getgo, it would have gotten a 4/5 Star rating... Seriously.... SIX hours of my life are gone because someone in OSImaging didn\'t get the memo that the BiOS/UEIF had a Windows 10S and not Windows 10Home, or 10RTMCore... If you manage to get this system with Windows 10S and not have to go through a ton of set up, or have the technical ability to do EVERYTHING I did it will be a good lightweight system. At the moment, I cannot confirm that any of the units available have the proper OS on them. I have posted the above information for anyone that might run into the same problem and really REALLY want to give the system a good shot before throwing it back in the box and sending it back.']}

It is super soft on the inside and has very durable construction! I like that it has a shoulder strap that is also very comfortable. While this fits the 2012 version perfectly, beware that it is way too big for the newer macbook pro versions! Do not buy this just because it has the shoulder strap if you have the newer macbooks because your computer will be sliding all over the place! I will wait and see if Tomtoc comes out with a smaller version of this bag, because the bag really is awesome.', b'I was looking for a minimal size bag for my 15" MacBook Pro and this bag fits it like a glove! I like the two pockets for extra accessories. I like that the opening for the laptop is from a side.The only thing I would change is make the shoulder strap a bit shorter. Currently it is too long and because of that the slidable buckle prevents the shoulder pad from being in the center.', b"Perfect for my Yoga 920.  I've gone through so many bags and sleeves and none of them fit properly (space inside so it moves around).  This one is PERFECT.  I like the side entry and fits like a glove.  The padded sides touch all edges of my 920.  The front pockets were perfect to put my pens, external DVD player, brick power supply, and multiple cables.  Still has room to spare.The only tiny knock I'll make (but not enough to take out a star) is that the blue is lighter than the picture.  Still looks fine and matches the Star Wars cover of my laptop.I also love that this is a slim case.  Easy enough to use like a slip case but with a handle and strap.Love it!", b'Just got this, so I can\'t vouch for long-term durability, but it looks to be high quality and durable construction with more padding than one usually sees in a sleeve-type case. The shoulder strap is plain webbing which I consider a plus because it will fold up small and tight if needed, and it has a high quality strap pad which will support more weight than you can possibly fit in this bag. The strap pad snugs tightly to the strap, meaning the strap isn\'t going to roll or tangle under the pad and the pad will stay where you put it on the strap. All zippers are installed correctly and work easily. Pockets are well sewn. In all, an impressive bit of design and engineering that is well executed.Two bones to pick, but not taking off any stars. Not what I like, but for other folks this might be exactly what they want.1. From the photo, I thought I\'d have more room in the front pockets than what is there. The pockets don\'t have much depth, and without gussets won\'t expand at all. Both front pockets have internal pockets for a pen and other small items you don\'t want rolling around in the main pocket, but if you put much of anything in the internal pocket, there won\'t be room for that bigger item you want to put in the main pocket. In the left (bigger) pocket I\'ve got a (Lenovo) power adapter attached to an APC PnoteProc8 surge protector (small, 600 Joules, highly recommended), AC cord in the main pocket, and a Yoga mouse (very thin) in the internal pocket.  In the right pocket I\'ve got an SD card reader, thumb drive, USB-C to USB-A adapter, and a pen in the internal pocket plus a business card wallet and phone charging cable in the main pocket. On the one hand, that is a full complement of what I need for travel, but on the other hand, that small complement of items completely fills both pockets. Both are on the edge of bulging with that load, and adding even one more small thing will overstuff the pockets, making them hard to close and causing the contents to possibly dig into your laptop despite the generous padding. That photo showing the pockets overflowing with goodies as if everything they show could fit in there is just B.S.  If you have more than what I describe, look for a different case. And note that the shoulder strap, which on a sleeve-style bag like this will mostly be carried in one of the pockets to be used only when traveling with overly-full hands, cannot fit in either pocket given what else I\'m carrying.  Tomtoc should have further differentiated this case from their non-shoulder-strap version by including pocket gussets on this model. A definite missed trick, even though that also would have increased the price.2. The max internal dimensions they list for the case are a bit misleading.  You can have one dimension at the maximum 12.8" or  the other dimension at the maximum 9.14" but not both. The problem is the really nice (read protective) edge padding, which is rounded at the corners.  My Lenovo Yoga 920 measures 12.68" x 8.81" and it just fits.  (Indeed, if I overstuffed the pockets, I would expect the fabric pulling on the inside faces of the pockets to cause the laptop to fit poorly and make the laptop zipper hard to close.)The padding and pockets make this thing thicker than a typical sleeve, but it still feels like a sleeve.  If you aren\'t carrying more than I describe, this case is the ticket.  At this price ($30 when I purchased), it\'s hard to go wrong.', b'I purchased this case for my new 15" MacBook Pro with touch bar- it fits nearly perfectly and is super snug. The pockets on the front hold the charger and some other stuff with room to spare,  and it seems to be durable and well made.', b'This is a great bag I use it to hold my mbp15\xe2\x80\x9d. In the side pouches I hold the mbp charger my phone and phone charger. The reason for the lower rating is that the stitching for the strap is starting to tear off. I have bought it end of October so it has been a little over a month of use and it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to fall apart.  I do use the bag on a daily basis for work and school. Was hoping for the strap to last longer. I will continue to use the bag as I like it a lot. But would prefer if the stitching was made to last longer than a month.', b"Love it. Looks very nice. Pretty slim (not too bulky). Did not own it for long but quality seems to be good. I can fit in there my 15.6 inch Yoga 720 with the power supply and medium sized mouse in separate compartments and still will have room for portable HDD. and some small accessories. The only thing is that the main pocket for the laptop is not on the top but on the side, so it came in a bit of surprise for me. I'm guessing they made that way so they can fit the handle on top which is very convenient.", b'After researching all possible carry bags for my new 13" 2017 MacBook Pro, I decided on this case because of the reviews and the style of the bag. I particularly liked the outside pockets which seemed perfect for peripherals like my mouse. I definitely made the right choice. My new MacBook Pro fits perfectly, and it\'s completely protected in this high quality case. I couldn\'t be more satisfied with the bag.After it arrived, however, I realized that many reviews stated how it came with a mousepad. This wasn\'t critical to me, but I sent a quick email to Tomtoc asking if a mousepad should\'ve been included. This was just a few days ago, and today in the mail, a mousepad was delivered! It\'s thin and just the right size so that it fits easily into the bag. I\'m delighted with the customer service of this company, and Tomtoc will be the first place I\'ll go in the future if they have the product that I\'m looking for. I highly recommend this bag and this company!']}

I chose an HP because the last one I had I liked. This does NOT disappoint! It's a great computer... and the keyboard is backlit!!! I'm SO happy about that! I can now put my itty bitty smartphone down when I'm in my living room and use my laptop again! I highly recommend this little laptop. GREAT value for the price.", b"Returned it same day. It already started to overheat after set up even though I had nothing running. I tried to download chrome and the installed web browser froze and crashed. Had to reset it and tried again and encountered the same problems. Also the screen is DIM. I sat it next to my boyfriend's Acer and its screen a little more than halfway was brighter than the HP at the highest setting. Also the keyboard is not backlit and the keys are clunky and stuck occasionally.The body itself is boxy and completely plastic so it's not durable at all.Overall I hated the look, feel and performance of this computer. I bought another one for about $100 less and I have had NO problems. Sorry HP :/", b'Hardware inside seems like it lives up to specs, but it gets hot and stays hot. The fan is loud and constantly runs.The case is very thin fragile plastic so you need to be very careful with it.The Bluetooth services are loaded and running, but Windows 10 does not recognize any radio hardware. This has to do with upgrading Windows 7 to Windows 10 without first uninstalling the HP Bluetooth services. You have to reformat and reload Windows to fix this error. A simple $20 Bluetooth USB device solves this, but you want to uninstall all of the HP bloatware and install the latest Broadcom Bluetooth drivers.The price is about $100 dollars too much for this set up.', b"So nice to have a laptop that works so quickly and well. It's just as good as Dell used to be, and the price was good too.", b'Would someone please explain to me why I bought another HP... This rating is apt to change depending upon capability of the company to satisfy this customer.  Unfortunately, I missed the return window by one day.  Yay me.  Cannot wait to shop for another system.  Life is great.', b'I like the item how it works the large screen because I\xe2\x80\x99m older need the larger screen for eye sight The back pack to carry it in is good for the younger persons to carry on back but also good for an older person like me to pack it in that when going on a trip My only disappointment wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the product it self It was because it was wireless I did assume a mouse would come with it and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t I would\xe2\x80\x99ve been willing to pay a little more for the item it was worth it to have the mouse come with it', b'I loved this laptop at first, but after just a few days, it started making a whirring noise and would not stop.I am in the process of returning it.', b'as ordered.

We are really disappointed.", b'The entertainment value is there, as well as being educational, but I wish there was an option for a backlight. Also, the mouse is very touchy; sometimes when our son tries to "click" it he moves it up/down instead.', b"I bought this little laptop for my 4 year old grandson a few weeks ago. He LOVES it. My little guy plays with it all the time. His 2 and a half year old brother also plays with it a some. I'm very happy with this toy. I haven't found anything about it yet that I don't like, and what's more important, neither has my grandson. Even after my 2 year old grandson spilt coke in it, it works perfectly. I simply cleaned it with a damp cloth, put paper towels in it and closed it, turning it upside down in order for any additional coke to drain out. We waited a couple of days and let it thoroughly dry out. Now it's as good as new. There are no problems with it after that accident, not even a stuck key. Awesome product. Well thought out and well built. I'm very happy with my purchase.", b'This is the sort of toy I have very mixed feelings about giving my kid. Lots of plastic, imitates adult life, etc...The graphics quality is totally acceptable.... for 1979.But my kid loves it. And the games are decently educational.', b'This is great for kids who love to "use" your laptop.  It\'s a great learning tool and my son feels like he\'s using a his own laptop.  The sounds aren\'t too obnoxious (truly important for parents lol).  All in all, it\'s a great product and my 20 month old loves it.  I bought it for him when he was around 16 months and I recommend it for any kids over 1.', b"It would be better if the screen was lit up and larger. I bought 2 of these, one in pink and one in orange for our great grandchildren. REALLY DISAPPOINTED about the fact that the pink one cost 25% more than the orange one for boys. Really V-tech??? Sexist much? Since both children have Dad's and a Grandpa in computer jobs they were excited about teaching the toddlers to play with them. We'll see what they have to say about how easy it is for the kids to learn and play with.", b"I'm a big fan of V-tech products so I was hoping this would be a great gift for my 2 year old, but this was very disappointing. The screen does not light up, it's very hard to use and not toddler friendly. (You have to literally push the button on the mouse for it to move subjects) No lights or interactive commentary to keep a toddler's interest. I would return it but we threw away the pkg that it came in so now we r stuck with this useless toy.I expected more from such a great brand like V-tech.", b'Always a great item!  We live in a small coastal tow with few choices to buy or access products. Amazon is our life saver and we can get exactly what we want or need.  Prices are always cheaper and the reviews tell us what users think or experience.  Thank you.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

It\'s just smaller than your usual full sized mice. It\'s not tiny, I should say, but it\'s still a good size that it\'s not lost in your palm. The buttons click with almost a snap, so you know it\'s doing it\'s job. The scroll works perfectly as well.

This is a perfect example of a company putting the time and effort to make a great mouse and having it be affordable for any gamer to pick up.Straight out of the box you can see and feel the quality of the build. It has a good weight and is very comfortable in the hand.  You shouldn't have any issues with your hand getting tired during a long gaming session.  Just plug it in and you'll notice the lights on the mouse and see how easy it is view the DPI setting just based on the color. I also love the breathing effect.  The Mouse in plug-n-play mode its great on it's own but then you add the included software and this is where the mouse comes alive.  From here you can change almost all aspects of the mouse.  From DPI settings (500-7000 dpi) to programmable buttons (8 buttons with 8 macro settings and 5 memory profile settings 15,000,000 keystrokes, 5800fps, 20G acceleration) to programming the LED's with 10 adjustable LED brightness,16,000,000 back-lit lights.  This truly has ever thing you need for a great gaming experience.  The braided cable is great and is a good length at 4.9 ft.  The only draw back to this mouse is the size of the male USB connector.  It is over-sized and doesn't always fit well with other USB's on the back of the PC.", b"I found myself at a point where the traditional two button mouse wasn't cutting in but not yet willing to dump $50 or more on a Razer or Logitech model. This was the perfect solution. It has a nice weight to it, the buttons have good action, are well placed, the cord is sturdy and braided and the scroll wheel has just the right amount of resistance. The software packaged with it really help to fine tune to your preferences. It is a little bit larger than your typical mouse, so it may not be comfortable if you have smaller than average hands. My hands are average/large and it is perfectly comfortable in my grip.The only minor gripe that I have with the unit is the USB plug itself. It is significantly larger than most. I did not feel comfortable plugging it in next to another item. It fit, but was extremely tight beside another USB connection, so I moved it to a spot where it could be plugged in alone. Not an issue for me as I have plenty of ports, but may be an issue for others. This issue is very minor and should not be a deal-breaker for many.I highly recommend this mouse for the casual gamer on a budget that needs something a little more substantial than the average web surfing mouse.", b"I've been looking for a wireless mouse for the office because my job is a bit antiquated and wires are everywhere!  The wired mouse I had was getting in the way and I found myself having to full on it at times because the wire would settle back and get wrapped up.  I've used TeckNet products in the past and this has been just as reliable as others I ordered.  It is lightweight and great size.  The scrolling is smooth and it does not stick or get stuck.  The grooves are slight so if your hands are larger or smaller, you dont feel awkward finding the grooves to click.The mouse takes one AA battery which is not included, on/off button (with auto-turn off after no activity for a few minutes), scroll with click and left and right buttons,  and you can store the usb doggle.  I was worried this would not work because my job's PC tower is on the ground, about 3ft away from the mousepad, but it works perfectly.  Happy I switched to wireless.  This is a basic, wireless mouse, nothing fancy so if all you need it for is standard computer work, it does it's job.", b"After going through 3 high dollar mice in 3 years, I was done paying the high prices for so called premium mice. Amazon just has too many mice listed now for way cheaper prices. I spent over an hour just surfing and reading some of the mice in the list (and bookmarked a bunch of them for future consideration). Got this one along with another one (different brand) for way cheaper than 1 mouse from all the big players. This is straight up a good mouse. I am a gamer and don't feel like I'm missing a thing from the high dollar bad boys. Probably has the same parts in it. Good deal for me, I'm quite happy with it and stoked about the price.", b"This mouse takes a bit of getting used to due to the different feel, but it works well for any computer application; not just games. However it is fully programmable (with the software on the included CD) and you can even program macros. It has an extra button that can be programmed as a fire button or whatever. The sensitivity can be changed with the DPI button, and the LED colors change each time you press it. The instruction manual has some typos, but it's still pretty helpful. My boys love playing games with it. I've enjoyed it for general computer use, and my wife is still getting used to it. :)"]}

First you will need about 3 hours to charge the battery, then Windows updates will take a couple of hours. Then it will take some time to get rid of the junk that all new computers come with (I\'m not a gamer, so lots of games had to go). If you are a Windows 10 pro, then you should be good to go. The last Windows computer I had was XP, so Win 10 took a while to get used to. I won\'t trade my Mac for anything, but I was at the point where I needed a new laptop to take on appointments with clients, and since they are all PC users it only made sense to go with a Windows machine.The computer isn\'t really gold at all, but more of a silvery color. I was worried that it would be flashy and "in your face" gold, but it is very subtle.The caps lock button doesn\'t let you know it is on, and that can get annoying when you accidentally hit it. There is also no separate numerical keypad, but maybe that is normal for laptops. I am more of a desktop user.Fingerprint technology is great, although about half the time it doesn\'t recognize me the first time and I have to do it again. Still, much faster than typing a password. Startup is super fast, literally only a few seconds. I was initially only looking for a $400 or so laptop since this won\'t get much use, but I am glad I splurged and got something with a much better processor and a SSD for the operating system.This laptop weighs next to nothing, and the screen is about the thickness of a few pieces of cardstock. Really, it\'s very impressive. I am still on my first battery charge, and have probably gotten 5-6 hours out of it, but it is warning me now that it is low.The only downside so far is no DVD drive. But I picked up an external Asus Zen Drive (SDRW-08U7M-U) for $29 and it works great. I don\'t need it often, but my iMac doesn\'t have a drive either, so now I am all set for both computers since it is plug and play.Overall, I\'m very impressed and glad that I chose this model out of the 40+ I looked at on amazon before deciding. I was worried that it wouldn\'t have enough RAM, and apparently your warranty is void if you put more in. But so far it is very adequate. If, after trying to run Photoshop and a bunch of other programs all at once it seems to be lagging, then I will update my review.', b"This is a punchy little laptop for its price that pleasantly surprised me in a lot of ways, and disappointed me in others.  Part of my amazement with some of it probably has to do with the fact that my everyday workhorse laptop is a couple of years old, now.  It certainly feels outdated next to this thing!  I'll start with the good.* The laptop is REALLY light.  When the box came, my husband didn't believe there could really be a laptop inside.  He thought I was joking when I told him that's what it was.  Weight doesn't honestly matter to me that much because I don't tote my laptop around, but if weight's an issue for you -- I really can't imagine laptops getting much lighter than this.* It turns on fast.  Really fast.  It has the OS on a solid state drive, and then a terabyte drive for storage, and the advantage to this is that solid state drives boot up super fast.  This is a laptop that I'd have less of a problem with shutting down regularly, because turning it back on again takes about the same amount of time as it takes my laptop to come out of sleep mode.  It's that fast.* It packs a fair amount of power without the heat.  I've tested it on both Overwatch and Minecraft, and while it won't do either of those games at their best graphics settings (or even near-best), it does run them, and runs them smoothly.  Moreover, it does so without producing a lot of heat, which surprised me.  I have ordered a fancy chill pad to go with this laptop, since I anticipate it's going to be doing a lot of playing games with high graphics requirements, but I'm not seeing a lot of heat issues, even without it.* I thought the whole 'thin bezel' thing was silly until I saw this laptop's screen.  It really does make my old laptop's screen seem outdated and clunky.* The speakers are decent, for what they are.  They don't have much of a bass, but they did bring out some things in the other registers of the music I was listening to that impressed me.  If you just want 'thump, thump, thump', they're not the speakers for you,  But they might hold up okay, for music that has a little more than that going on.* Battery life was pretty decent.  My roommate played Overwatch for hours on it and didn't realize that it wasn't plugged in.Now the bad:* This is the biggest concern I have with this laptop:  The charger gets REALLY hot, and the wire itself seems flimsy.  Between the hot charger and the flimsy wire, I'm expecting that my charger isn't going to last long. This isn't something I'm terribly comfortable leaving plugged in and walking away, either.* It comes with a lot of bloatware which you then have to go through and uninstall, which is kindof a pain.  I don't get why companies do this.  Also, it tries to push McAfee on you.  I don't know why companies do this, either.* The speakers, while decent, could be better.  But I've been saying that about my laptops for years, and have yet to own one where they ARE better.  Still, when my iPhone has better sound, it feels like there's room for improvement.* Given how light and thin it is, I'd actually be a little afraid to tote this thing around too much without some kind of really protective case.  It seems like it could get damaged too easily.", b'The laptop is a good value for what it provides. But, the screen and sound though fair are a little underwhelming. My older ASUS NV53V has much brighter screen and it sounds a lot better than this one.Everything else is top notch.----Update 7/19/2017I have used this laptop for a month now. To be fair, the display and sound are both as one would expect other laptops in the price bracket. In the era of rating inflation, I will up my rating to full 5 stars.', b"I've had this laptop for a few months and I love it a lot. It boots up in seconds and makes it so easy to get on task faster. I take it with me to school and its light enough that I don't feel like I'm carrying bricks. The battery lasts for 7 hrs and I usually dont charge it for two days bc I mostly use it for school work and only play one game on Steam. I don't really use it for heavy software, so I don't know how powerful it is for that.My main problem, though, is that sometimes the mousepad will stop working for a minute or two, or it will lag, but with my wireless mouse it's fine. It never lags or stops working. With the mousepad, I will try to right click but it will act like I intended to left click. It's frustrating, since I dont take my wireless mouse with me everywhere.Overall, I'm happy with it."]}

With over 90 years of quality products and service, Tripp Lite is a brand you can trust.', b"I've been searching for a new monitor riser because of absolutely horrible neck pain for around 5 years now and my old riser, the metal kind with the bend in the frame was causing me to look up too often to see the top of my monitor.  I picked this riser because of the many different height adjustments you can accomplish with the leg pieces.  I ended up just using the longer legs and it is Perfect.  I can even still fit my organizer box underneath it where I keep thing like letter openers, lens spray, things I like to keep at arms length because I spend so much time at my desk.  I am glad they had black as I am not a fan of grey.  It blends right in with my black desk pad and monitor so don't even know its there.  I also chose this riser because of the Tripp Lite name. I have had other computer accessories made by them and have always had good quality, good prices and  good aesthetic appeal.", b'I purchased this base after looking around for many alternatives to raise my monitors that had a large enough area to hold and raise the base of my multi-monitor stand (to eye level).  Most bases I found are long enough but very narrow. Usually made only for one or two monitors.I have a 3-monitor stand  that holds three 27 inch HQHD monitors (heavy!). The whole thing is about 73 lb. This is rated to 80+ pounds.The stand is holding fine and the swivel moves with ease. I have been using it for 4  weeks so far.', b'Decent monitor riser, but not fully adjustable.  It comes with 1.25" high feet and 2" feet, which may be snapped together to adjust height according to your needs.  Unfortunately, for my tv to sit on this with the small cable box underneath, the 1.25" legs are too short and the 2" ones are too high- it wont fit under my upper cabinet.  I would give this 5 stars if this was fully adjustable and it could do "anywhere" between the 1.25 and 4" like the write-up says.. but this is going to be returned.  If you don\'t have a specific area to accommodate, then this would be a very nice riser.', b'I needed a small shelf for my computer monitor, which is in a computer armoire, so I had a limited space for it to fit.  I wanted to free up some space to stash my keyboard.  I bought this one because it had options for height, and it fits perfectly.  It was easy to assemble, gives me more usable storage space, and is exactly what I needed at a reasonable price.', b'Most monitor stands have a minimum height a good deal higher which is usually too high. This product has several height options starting with a very low rise height which was perfect for my needs. Good quality too', b'Not perfect but did the trick.', b'I bought these for dual monitors that were not the same height and they work perfectly.  Solid plastic.', b'Solid construction and materials.  Perfect if you are looking for something in the cube; maybe a little basic if you are looking for something seen on your executive desk.  But it was exactly as described and delivered promptly.  If I had to do it over, I would.']}

{'asin': 'B00V4V3TWA', 'title': 'Amazon.com: Video & TV Cast for Fire TV: Best Browser to stream any web-video on HD-TV displays: Appstore for Android', 'price': '', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b'I think it "Sucks" the casting device it\'s self is very much like the other brand of casting device. But the other brand is pretty much plug and play. The confusion for me on this is exactly which App I needed to download. It appears there might be different ones for my Apple Products, and my Android Tab 3 and then there\'s the Windows Laptop and last but not least the family\'s iMac. So I started by trying to get it on and make it work on a laptop running windows-10 when finally made a choice and downloaded the above listed Software/Application it seems very picky about how one signs on to the internet. I have three choices and at times I need a specific one, so after a few tries I\'ll finally get on, But this App then starts constantly bumping me, and showing down in the address box at the bottom of the browser the "No Video to Cast"  message. Even though I can just select a different browser and my selected video will be playing fine there. So when I go back to try and correct it and recast, It just keeps hunting for the signal and the message stays the same.  So the one Star is only there\'s not way to award less than that. So if it were not that I didn\'t have to pay $ for it, because it was a Free Direct TV.Promotion offered by AT&T, I would demand my $$ back and go buy a Chrom Cast Device', b'Great app!  Works just like Chromecast to the Fire TV (they have an app for Chromecast also).  Using the browser, you navigate to the page with the video, it finds the link automatically, and you click the cast link at the bottom.  Very easy to use.  No jitter or stoppage of the video at all.  Works the same as cast for the Netflix, video routes through the router and does not rely on the graphics card of the device.', b'I have a fire stick and TV and it works beautiful. I paired it with my iPhone, and iPad and tested it on my TV, if you are in my case, just be sure you select the actual one you are using and it will cast perfectly to your TV. No more trying to view small contents such as tutorials on my iPad mini I now can see the content on TV and can follow along on my laptop. I recommend to download.', b"I  downloaded this thinking it was something else.  As I got into it i realized that you also have to download the app for your phone as well.  I didn't try it because I did t want to put the app on my phone so I can't be much help other then to say, if you download this on your fire stick make sure you get it for your phone, tablet as well.", b'Let me just say THIS before that single star gets incorrectly interpreted...."I haven\'t been able to cast ANY CONTENT from ANY DEVICE as of this review. Unfortunately, my Kindle is not readily available to test my current theory that only Amazon devices can cast to Amazon Fire TV. The ONE STAR RATING is actually an EMPTY STAR, meaning I needed to give a minimum of one star for the Review Privilege ( I rate this product 0 stars) THANK YOU', b"Didn't work. Apparently you need to download a corresponding app to your streaming device. In other words, if you want to stream to FireTV, you need the app on Fire AND you need the app on your iPhone or Android. Apart from that, there are really no instructions for making this work and I was unable to get it to do so.", b'I downloaded this app to watch a video from my phone on the tv.This app did not ever connect. The app downloaded on my phone and fire stick but they could not connect to each other. It looked like it would have done what I wanted to do, if they would connect. I tried uninstalling and restarting and it never found my tv. I uninstalled the program.', b"Installed this on my Fire TV Stick and on my iPhone. Installation was easy enough, and my iPhone found the Fire TV Stick, but videos didn't play very well (sometimes not at all), and there was no option to view photos. It played video from web pages reasonably well, but that's not really why I needed it."]}

{'asin': 'B01KC7WGQQ', 'title': 'Amazon.com: ARVICKA Blue LED USB Speakers- Wired Laptop Speakers 2.0 Channel Small Computer Desktop Speakers for PC, Echo Dot, Updated Version, Black: Computers & Accessories', 'price': '', 'date': '                        August 13, 2016\n                        ', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b"I was looking for specific characteristics, and this nailed ALL of them. I was nervous for the price ( incredibly cheap ), but now that they've proven themselves, the price only sweetens the deal.Here's what I was looking for: - SMALL. I like my desktop to have an uncluttered zen, and these babies are just more than the size of my fists. - AESTHETIC: I wanted a nice, modern looking speaker... no grids protecting the speaker or anything old school. That in combination with the soft blue led glow, and my desktop is looking very appealing. A nice place to relax after work. - SOUND: It's a tall order for small speakers to sound good. Now, this is a subjective thing, and I'm no audiophile, but I'm pleasantly impressed with what these can do. They fill my living room when I play some rock music on a sunny day, and they play my video game sounds well. - INEXPENSIVE: I just didn't want to pay very much. I like the efficiency of getting all of the above for less than $15.Here are the cons, which don't matter to me AT ALL. These might matter to others though:CONS: - Though they look modern and chic on the desktop, if you actually pick them up they feel like a cheap china-town trinket. That's not a slur, if you've been to China Town, Manhattan, you know what I mean. - They require both USB *and* aux cable to be plugged in. More sophisticated (expensive) products might only require USB, and register as a USB sound device on your system. Others might only require the aux cable, though they would be very quiet then.That's it. I've had these for weeks and it still puts me in a good mood every time I see them on my desk!", b"Very nice! Far better than the Dell All-In-One computer's internal speakers as the A-I-O also serves as a TV.  These speakers connect to a rear edge USB port and the Audio Out jack so wiring is behind the A-I-O and thus out of sight, as are the speakers! You don't even know they are there until listening to them - and then you sure do!!  As the power from the USB port to the speakers turns off when the computer is shut down, simply adjust the speaker's volume control knob once, and forget about it. This means the power on/off for the speakers is automatic.The speakers' audible output level is more than sufficient, and the tonal response is quite adequate in spite of the small size.  Using the All-In-One's computer audio settings and equalizer really has these sounding quite good. With the FiOS Quantum cable box, Dell All-In-One, and these speakers out of sight, it makes for a rather aesthetic, compact, clean with no wires showing, double duty system on a kitchen desk - -  and offers really great video and audio.", b'These seemed great at first - the sound quality was good (especially for the price) and the units are compact.  Unfortunately, six weeks after using them, they developed a bad static/buzzing sound which was very annoying and distracting. With the best customer service on Amazon, the supplier, iGotSmart, replaced them even though it was past the return date. (They proactively contacted me when they saw my review!)  The replacements are great.  A fantastic speaker set for the price!', b'I am quite impressed with the quality and output of the sound from these inexpensive speakers.  I wanted much smaller speakers for my office computer since I already have too much clutter, but did not want to invest in expensive top of the line speakers because I mostly play soft music for background noise or have to listen to audio files for work sometimes but nothing major.The speakers are loud - I mean - I have to keep them on pretty low volume, otherwise my paralegal would probably complain, but even when I did crank up the volume, the sound output was quite impressive - no crackling or scratching, just loud music.The speakers are like 2" x 2" or so - so they take up very little room on the desk, just like I wanted, the blue light is a little distracting but some people are really into that kind of look - me, not so much, but it was in the description so I knew what I was buying.The only thing I do not like about the speakers is the length of the cord.  I would take off half a star but that isn\'t an option so because I had to buy an extender just to connect the speakers, I took a star off.  If you have a typical desk setup with the tower on the ground and the monitor and speakers on an elevated desk - you\'re going to need an extender cable.', b'These little speakers are simply awesome!!  Love the blue lights that shine underneath!  They are VERY loud for the size and the quality of the sound exceeded the price as well as my expectations .  I use these speakers to watch movies on my computer by the way.  You will not be disappointed!', b'Speakers arrived promptly. They pack quite a sound for being so small. Just plugged in to an outlet and into my Echo Dot and bam great sound.', b'Great little speakers for the money. I plugged them into my 42" 4K TV, which had some rather muffled sound. I plugged these into the USB port and the headphone jack on the TV and the sound is now 10x better. The reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is because there is a lot of hum coming from the speakers. If the volume is turned down, you can hear it. Fortunately, the hum doesn\'t get louder when you turn up the TV volume.']}

It\'s perfect for that and the price can\'t be beat. If you look at reviews on this HP Stream some complained about not enough storage to even update Win 10.  There is an easy fix, you just go into settings>storage>this PC and look for the option to "delete previous version". I assume that means the Win 8 which came before. I had the same error message that there was no room to update it. After deleting the previous version I now have 9Gig still empty, which is plenty for her to use. Store your docs and photos in the cloud and you won\'t have any problems at all. You\'ll have to go through several updates to get the program current. I use Chrome instead of Edge and Libre Office for an office suite.', b"I'm always weary about buying refurbished technology but the price on this made it too tempting to pass on. For the value, this computer has served all of my needs for school purposes. I would recommend if you need something to do word documents on or surf the Internet with.", b"Great little lap top for the price! Be aware that the solid state hard drive is quite small, though. I loaded MS Office and VLC Media player and had to delete a bunch of bloat ware to get those two apps on the drive. The space that remains is not large enough to accept any new Windows updates. I may have to delete some more. I expected that, however, and its main purpose is not compromised. For $159. you can't beat it.", b"It's perfect! I also love how quickly it arrived. It was a smooth process and the laptop looks brand new. Definitely impressed.", b'fast fast fast and love it', b'For what I paid for this computer, I believe it was well worth it. its sleek and light weight, and a pretty blue color. I mostly use it for homework and to surf the web. This computer runs pretty fast, and comes with a one years worth of Microsoft Word and etc. If you need this for homework or school, I would gladly recommend this computer.Side note: I had this computer for about 4-5 months now.', b'I was very pleased with how this computer looked when it arrived. I have had it over 20 days now with no issues, unlike my last computer, in which it all of a sudden would not turn on around the same time. It is easy to use and I am happy with the features.', b'This a great little computer and well worth the price. Really thin, small and lightweight, fits easy in my 14" laptop bag. It does not have a backlit keyboard (which I knew before buying). Comes with Office, but if you\'re buying it refurbished and it was already activated, you will not get it. I already had an Office license, so it wasn\'t a big deal, but if you\'re buying it for Office, you may not receive the year free.Just a heads up there.It only has 32GB of internal memory, but you can easily save files to SD card. The track pad is a hard to use for some reason, but if you use a mouse it\'s no biggie.']}
{'asin': 'B00DU8W6DI', 'title': 'Amazon.com: Guerrilla Painter LapTop Painting Box, 9 by 12-Inch', 'price': '', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b"I've used this box for over a year now and I like it. When I first ordered it Guerilla Painter accidentally sent me the larger 9x12 Pochade box, so I had some time to compare both side by side. The Laptop is definitely a better choice if you value portability and light weight.I bike and/or hike to painting locations so I wanted something very trim. The Laptop allows me to have a full painting set up - 8-10 tubes, medium cups, brushes, pencil & ruler, knife, and gloves - and still thin enough to fit in a backpack with a tripod.  The only thing I need to carry externally is a small can for solvents and some paper towels.  Holds 2 panels easily - might hold 3 if you tweak the clips a little.People have complained about the lack of panel sizing and I can see that being annoying.  But the box is a sturdy foundation that could be easily hacked to fit specific needs.", b"Great for plein air painting! Fits all of my materials and is perfect for watercolor/gouache...It is a little heavy but, maybe I'm working with more than I need..?", b'Love it. Use it for plein air pastels. It has not disappointed me.', b"I found the box to be well constructed and clever in it's design.  It is my first Pochade box and as such, will always be something I remember fondly.  That said, I have found the limitations to be more than I am willing to deal with, so have ordered something else.  This box only holds 9/12 panels.  If you want to use the same panel as a 12/9...you will need to use clamps to keep it in place.  Once you add on the various accessories to make it more flexible you end up with a slightly less inflexible system--for the price of a high end system.", b'This was a great investment for plein aire painting. I had tried to make due with other choices, but then got frustrated and bought this one. The size is perfectly planned to hold all my stuff, and still be light enough to carry with me.', b'Beautifully made, easy to carry and use. The only problem is the knob does not tighten so you can put any degree of pressure on the canvas without it moving.']}

Comparing this to my grandma's HP Pavillion 15 laptop(that is around 500$ or up), the display looks just as nice despite lower resolution. Browsing and streaming could run a little choppy at times in ad-filled websites, but that should not be a problem at all if it had an adblocker installed. Also,unlike the HP Pavillion 15, it lacks a CD drive and an internal fan. I find this to be good for my needs because the lack of those renders this laptop dead quiet and its battery life runs about 6-10 hours on heavy video and web browsing before it hits 10%. Besides,this laptop never heats up to the point it is intolerable,so by cutting out the things I don't use, I get almost triple the battery life the HP Pavillion could get(only lasted 3 to maybe 5 hours..).", b"By far the worst piece of crap I've ever had. It was an emergency laptop for school, since my other laptop broke so I didn't have enough money. But the thing didn't even wait 2 days to start acting up. When it's not acting up I really like it. It is a very cute laptop but it freezes too much and I hate the automatic updates. The battery life is good though. So two stars because when it works it works fine but if I'm using it for awhile it starts acting up. The freezing, shutting down, freezing to the point where I can't do anything not even save my documents(thank God for auto recovery)P.S I love the colorUpdateThis laptop freezes when charger is plugged in for at least a minute.", b"Purchased this Laptop for my eight year old's FIRST computer.  He's managed to destroy 3 pads and thus, I decided he was better off with a 'stationary' pc.  He's been fabulous with it and for the price it can't be beat.  Comes with Windows 10 and once I set up parental controls he's been thriving.  He's so proud to be a 'big boy' and has been extremely careful with it.  He reads everything on the screen and it has helped with his typing skills.  Best purchase ever.  Thank you", b'To start: I paid $159.99 for this (refurbished). I purchased this so I could be a bit more flexible in my location for doing college homework, work, and freelance writing without being tied to my desktop 24/7. The white color scheme is just a visual pleasure (opinion), and it really gives a feeling of a MUCH more expensive machine. In fact, you wouldn\'t look TOO out of place among the Mac users if you wanted to pack it up and head to your local coffee shop! If you\'re buying this to play modern games, well obviously you\'re going to be disappointed, but I\'m willing to bet this can play almost anything 10 years or older. While I haven\'t tried any actual PC games of that era, I\'ve done a bit of emulation consisting of NES/SNES/N64/PSX and they\'ve all ran flawlessly. Grab yourself a nice Bluetooth controller and you\'ve got quite a bit of (retro) gaming on the go!There are those that complain about the storage, and I\'ll admit, it\'s a bit sparse at stock, but with the advent of tiny USB 3.0 thumb drives that nearly sit flush with the port, as well as SD cards, there should be no issues in the long run. I do recommend, however, to download Windows 10 from Microsoft and make a USB installer, wiping the contents of the drive, and then installing fresh. You\'ll find some quite unnecessary bloatware when you first receive it, and when you\'re working with a low powered machine like this the last thing you want is unwarranted background tasks eating your resources!Another item I wanted to touch on is the screen. At 14", 720p is ON THE VERGE of being too low, but it serves its purpose just fine. Had the device incorporated a 1080p display, the added pixels would just bog the integrated graphics down even more along with draining extra battery. This thing is meant to be portable, and the stellar battery life is awesome, so the screen compromise is well worth it. If things are too big, you can adjust the sizes of elements within Windows 10, as well as the zoom level in most browsers.Finally, on the topic of productivity -- mainly the keyboard and trackpad. I was shocked by the quality of the keys at such a low price! While I realize this computer was something like $299 new at launch, even at that price I\'d consider this a very nice keyboard/trackpad. I\'ve experienced no missed clicks or keystrokes, nor input delay of any kind!All in all, a super awesome buy if you want something basic and aesthetically pleasing for a GREAT price!', b"I've had it for 2 weeks and really love it! I was apprehensive at first, but it turned out to look and act good as new. It was sent to me real quick (three days from order date), and packaged well. My mom was looking for a laptop, so I ended up getting a second one for her, and it works just as well as mine.One of my favorite things about it (amongst others) is how comfortable I feel typing on it. I'm a slow typer compared to my fellow millennials, but i tend to type fast with this keyboard. Overall, feeling really good about my typing skills.Anyways, its a great product! Not sketchy at all!", b'The Bluetooth radio stopped working. Support was not very supportive. It was suggested that I use the "smart friend service" which I would have to pay for. Other than Bluetooth everything has worked fine.', b'This computer would\xe2\x80\x99ve been awesome, 1st month the speakers would work then crackle then work then crackle.

They didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay me I paid for their garbage which they\xe2\x80\x99re getting back!', b"Although this computer is refurbished, it looks brand new! It's such a beautiful laptop and I love it so much. I haven't updated OneDrive yet, but it runs normally. The screen is so big, the keyboard has a nice touch, the Windows is easy to use, and the price for this laptop is fantastic. I use this laptop for my school work, and it's so much fun."]}

It does require two USB connections to operate, and the cords aren't that long, so be aware of that. I've used this to install software and rip audio CDs and it works like a charm...great for my new Dell PC running Windows 8, which came sans CD drive. The only real bad thing about this CD drive is that it makes a lot of noise. Might be irritating if you plan to play CDs without ripping them. On the whole though, I feel good about having bought this drive.", b"I have been looking for a while for one since my new laptop doesn't have a cd drive which is annoying but Wtvr so I read all these reviews was little undecided so I just ordered it. And it works perfectly with all my laptops even windows 8.1 and windows 10. Also windows 7. It's pretty fast with the install took about 2 mins. I've been burning all my DVDs and it's very quick for this price it's amazing I definitely recommend this to everybody", b'I wanted this because the internal CD drive had malfunctioned. After i had opened the box and read the tiny instructions, I discovered that in order to use this product with a laptop I needed to find a "phone cord." What they wanted was the type of cord that has a 2-prong electric plug on one end and, at the other end, a speaker jack plug of the right size to fit their receiver port. Unfortunately, what is currently thought of as a "phone cord" is one with the little clips on both ends\xe2\x80\x94the kind you find when you search for that term on Amazon.I believe that if any extra equipment is needed to operate a product, that need should be included in the product description. I\'m generously giving this a second star since it seems that it might work if hooked to a desktop computer.', b'Purchased it to use on a new laptop with Windows 10 installed. The system recognizes that a drive is present, but would not read most of my data CDs and did not recognize commercially manufactured music CDs.I did not test it with DVDs, since I primarily purchased it for importing music into iTunes.  Having failed that one purpose, there was no reason to continue.On the positive side, the printed instructions were clear and included and email to their technical support.  An email question to them was promptly replied and they suggested I return it.  So back it goes.It gets two stars because description does not indicate its failure to work on Windows 10 (a reviewer says it does, though).However, manufacturer was responsive and helpful.', b"I am having issues installing this to my daughters laptop. It wont install and I cant seem to find anything for software. I am not impressed at all. It said that it was super easy to install but I have not been able to install it. Plug and play means you plug it in and it pops up with the installing prompts...this is NOT how it works, I haven't gotten any prompts except to eject the disk inside it. I cant get any games to work or movies.", b'I was fortunate enough to receive a complimentary Alienware laptop to review. However I was surprised to find that it lacked a DVD drive - and I thought that was surprising in a computer retailing for over $2,000. So I needed to find an external DVD drive to do the job for me. This Coolead DVD seems to do the job for me. I find it mildly geeky that I need to use up two DVD ports when using the drive. I am also puzzled as to why this apparently does not support Blu-Ray. But, all in all, this does what I need.', b"I really dislike the power connection.  Many others use two USB connections into one USB to power the drive.  Some of the old servers i have attempted to rebuild with this have failed and i simply went to using USB ISO mounters!Had i only needed this to burn CD's if is flawless but due to the the way it pulls power via USB it has not worked 100% of the time.ALSO side note DO NOT plug in a 5volt USB connection into its power connection it also will power the USB and all 5 volt devices on an off server.  The drive itself does not have any power protection for the dual Power ports.  Due to this its possible to burn out your USB ports while using this.", b"I was very disappointed with this product. I ordered this as my laptop doesn't have a disc drive included and I had some software I needed to load onto my computer. I got it, plugged it into my computer, added the disc, heard it spin......then nothing. I tried plugging it into different usb ports on my laptop but to no avail. I tried different discs, but still nothing. I have an Acer laptop with Windows 10. I sent it back and bought a CD reader/writer from BestBuy instead, that is MUCH better, only uses one cable, and is even smaller/slimmer than this. It was a little more cost wise, but you get what you pay for I guess."]}

It arrived in excellent condition, both operationally and in appearance. I was able to activate the installed Windows 7 with no problems. I bought this machine to use in my ham radio station for keeping logs, interfacing with radio transceiver, and using various hobby-related websites. While it does seem a bit slow compared to newer computers, it is fine for my purposes. Windows 7 also is OK with me. Not sure if I'll upgrade to Windows 10. The battery life is very good. The computer came with 4GB RAM and I probably will upgrade it to 8GB in the near future. Since this computer does not have a CD/DVD drive, I likely will buy an external drive for less than $25 for those infrequent times when I could use one. All in all, I am happy with my purchase and feel this was a very good buy. I recommend this seller based on this purchase.", b'Purchased on line several months ago as a refurbished unit when in California (what does California have to do with it?) Anyway, the unit has proven to be satisfactory for mostly web surfing and video downloading. The delete key does have a tendency to stick occasionally and is the only complaint. The fingerprint log in feature was a pain but it can be eliminated. It was advertised as 350gb hard drive but showed only 290 gb net usable but no problem as external hdd solves that issue.', b'Looked brand new. Needed very little in the way of updates and set up. Very pleased to be able to get windows 7 pro instead of 10. Working fine months later...', b"I am not happy. worked great the first month we had it now after the return window closed we have a message saying our windows product key is no longer valid and we must buy a new one. This should not happen. I want something done about this as it isn't right to sell something and then revoke a product key after a return window.", b"The laptop looks and feels sturdy and well-constructed. It has rubber padding around the edge of the screen for protection - which is nice. It is a bit heavy for its size.However a few days after it arrived, the Delete key wasn't pressing quite right. It seems that one of the plastic clips underneath it has split and so the key is no longer settling properly. That is not nice, especially as that key has hardly been used so far. It is going to cost too much to return it. Even getting a replacement key is an expensive undertaking so I guess I am stuck with it.", b"So far I really like my new think pad.  I installed Ram upgrade to 8 GB.  The only problem I have is the prompt comes up for fingerprint ID, but I can't set it up.got it for watching video's.  I love the fast start up. It has a comfortable keyboard, mouse pad is usable, I like that it has windows 7 pro instead of 10. For the price I couldn't ask for more.  I was able to download Lenovo support which is really helpful.  I would recommend this laptop to all.", b'Getting used to the feel and handling...like a little car!', b"Needed a small system for our microscope and this unit worked well, looked like bran new.. Doesn't get used often but that wasn't the intent so should last a lifetime. Right tool for the right job.."]}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

I was reluctant to buy refurbished, but he convinced me I would never be able to afford a computer that was this fast and of this quality if it were new. Well, he was right.

Outside top shell has slight imperfections and i mean slight like A hairline swirl. Definitely buy this and from them!', b'This is the second time I have purchased a refurbished computer.

She has put Sims, and the expansion packs on the laptop and it works great!', b"This computer was FULL of bloatware. EBAY, Netflix, Priceline and other obnoxious applications. After going through and deleting all the crap, I am happy with this laptop. It is still running a bit slower than I imagine it should, but I'm going to have my brother-in-law check my apps again and help me with it.", b'Setup took some hours, but thats Microsoft, not Acer.  Runs fine. Not lightning fast but definitely an affordable upgrade from where I was. Task manager took 3 seconds to open...not sure what that other reviewer is talking about. Laptop construction feels a little cheap, but you get what you pay for. Fan is audible but not loud. Will have to remove bloatware tonight though there doesnt seem to be a lot. If youre buying this for gaming you should also look for an external graphics card cause the built in one wont handle much if you want newer games.', b'I bought this laptop for my husbands birthday. He had issues with the update which took FOREVER. He complained about it being extremely slow (please note our WIFI speed is 110 MBPS) he\xe2\x80\x99s had to do a hard reboot several times and still is not working properly.He\xe2\x80\x99s not wanting to send it back but we may have to.', b'For Home and lite work related tasks this Acer exceeds expectations.  At 4.6 lbs it easily moves around the most common workspaces at home and we are satisfied with build quality out of the box.  5 to 6 hour battery life is about right at this point.  This is the Acer 3 with specs as advertised.', b'Bear in mind that the windows 10 does not come installed.you have to install it and it took me a solid 3 hours.but this laptop is perfect for basic needs.', b'I had to return mine as defective.  Very long boot-up time, and it would frequently get hung up on different web pages with no rhyme or reason.  Screen frequently froze up and was not responsive to mouse pad or standard mouse.  Overall, a big disappointment.', b"Do not buy this product. I bought it despite the negative reviews and based solely on the price and what I thought was decent performance. This computer is slow, unresponsive and seems to have been infected with malware and recommissioned and sold as new. Do yourself a favor and if you're going to invest in a laptop don't invest solely on price. I have been trying to download an app from the windows store (Windows Scan) so I can scan tax forms to complete my taxes. Its been 25 minutes and the download has not even moved from 1%. It takes 2 minutes to open Google chrome to the homepage of Google. I have 100 mb/s internet speed so it's definitely not my internet. My tablet, phones, Xbox and firestick work great on the internet. This computer simply can't do basic functions in a halfway timely manner. I am completely disappointed with it. Do not buy."]}

First of all, I'm a freelance writer and photographer, so I will be heavily using Microsoft Office, GIMP, Grammarly, and Spotify. Here are my first impressions (I'll update this review as needed).Pros:I was able to load everything very quickly. It seems like the AMD9 processor is going to do the job well.I've had no problem multitasking thanks to the SSD and 8GB RAMIt's ultra lightweight, which is good because I already have a camera body and a few lenses in my backpack.The 14-inch 1080p screen is way better than the standard def 15.6-inch screen on my old laptop.The built-in SD drive saves me a USB port.Cons:There's no separate keypad on the keyboard, but that is to be expected on a very small laptop.Cortana is obnoxious during startupI had to get rid of a ton of preloaded stuff I didn't want.The video memory is shared (won't matter to me, but I wanted to mention this for gamers or video editors)Let's be honest, it can't match up to the desktop I built for myself specifically to run my business. That having been said, it's a simple and cost-effective way to keep running my business as I travel the world (which is the whole point of my business). I recommend this laptop for freelance writers and photographers, but the shared video RAM is a no-no for video editing or heavy gaming.", b"Got it for an acquittance. So far working great, a bit worried as an early adopter that it doesn't show up at ASUS official website. Upgrading (actually, replacing) from an Asus X54C from 2012 (6 years old, that I also recommended, same price point/bracket) that started to fail. The difference in speed/power is awesome. The power adapter is very tiny (I also have a thin Asus Zenbook with a compatible adapter that is about 150% the size of this one), even more compared to the power brick from before.  The owner is hyper happy.Hopefully will last another 6+ years!", b'It\xe2\x80\x99s loud. Not sure why but all I hear is this thing thinking and the noise comes from the speakers on the top. Aside from this it\xe2\x80\x99s built poorly. Be very careful with it it\xe2\x80\x99s very lightweight and as a result I think it\xe2\x80\x99s made from foam. It is pretty fast so if your willing to wear earplugs and never move with it, it should get done what you need it too.', b'Shipping arrived earlier as expected, highly recommended, great Product, overall very much satisfied!!!', b'This computer is nice but the noise of the fan is incredibly loud. It was disturbing me so much that I had to return it.', b'I received this laptop quickly on a Tuesday, by Friday I had to return it. After updating and setting everything up I kept getting an error message "application blocked from accessing graphics hardware" whenever I would try to watch a video, which then would crash the computer. I searched online to try to find a fix including uninstalling/reinstalling drivers and more to no avail. The Amazon product assistance said it was probably a hardware issue and issued a refund.', b'Laptop fan was very loud. Speakers produced a lot of static. Returned.']}

My experience with "Certified Refurbished" is that a customer bought something, and for some small reason, the item was returned to the manufacturer who fixed it and then slapped the "Certified Refurbished" label on there and the item is supposed to be better than new in many cases.  But this thing came out of the box reeking of the abuse that it had received. This Chromebook had been heavily used -- signs of wear all over it in terms of scratches and paint literally worn off.  It was horrible.  But I am a good sport. I took responsibility because I had stupidly failed to read the reviews -- most of them warned me that this would happen!

I have had many of refurbished cell phones in the past with no issues, I thought it would be along the lines of that. As soon as I took it out of the box, I noticed scratches all over, some looked like chips. This was for my daughter for Christmas and time was running out, so I bought her a pretty purple cover for it and hoped that would be okay. A couple of weeks ago we noticed a broken part by the USB ports, and the real kicker, we have only had this for just over 2 months, and she opened it today to the screen looking cracked from the inside and very damaged, it was fine when she was done using it last night and put it in its case and up off the floor when she went to bed. There seems to be no reasoning for this, other than I should have paid $30 more for a brand new product, even though we have only had it 2 months, I don't think there is a thing that can be done, I will just have a very upset little girl until I can afford to buy her a new one.", b'I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend purchasing.

{'asin': 'B005OSFT90', 'title': 'Bt - Laptop Symphony - Amazon.com Music', 'price': '', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b'It has been my experience that when a DJ releases a two CD set, you only get about 1 CD\'s worth of good music.  This set is no different, even though it is by my favorite DJ.  What you hear on this CD will be exactly what you hear on BT\'s Laptop Symphony Podcast, so check that out first before buying this set.If you do opt for these CDs, know that each one is very different.  The first is BT\'s experimentation with Dubstep, Hardcore, and Breakbeat.  The second is BT\'s home turf of Trance, House, and Progression.  So there is pretty much something for everyone in these two CDs.Personally, I favor the second more than I do the first.  There are songs in the first that sound like Humpty Dumpty was a Vinyl.  All BT\'s horses and all BT\'s men couldn\'t put the song back together again.  They are, IMO, nothing more than noise.  There is nothing symphonic about them.  I loved BT\'s work in breaking down and rebuilding sound in This Binary Universe, but this is very different.  It is for this reason if I was to burn a CD of my favorite songs from these CDs, 2/3 of the songs would be from the 2nd disk.For a "flavor" of what each CD is like, listen to "Madskillz - Mic Chekka" from Movement In Still Life, and then listen to some Deadmou5.  It\'s a combination of the two for the first CD.  The second CD is a combination of BT\'s work in Emotional Technology and These Hopeful Machines.BT is branching out, and he does a good job at it, but his transitions and song selection for the Dubstep need more work.  The second CD is worth the price however if you\'ve followed and loved BT up to this point!For a digital purchase, here are the tracks I would recommend:1st Disk:Tomahawk (with Adam K)Choose Me IIHello (Featuring Sue Cho) (Dub Mix)All My Love (Featuring Jada Pearl) (Xilent Remix)Cloudburn (Featuring Tasha Baxter)Robo Booty  (Note:  This one is like Galaxy Bounce by Chemical Brothers)Flying Blind (Featuring Jes) (vs. Killbot-War Paint Mashup Mix)2nd Disk:Counting the Points (Original Mix)That Much HigherIn The Air (Mord Fustang Remix)Without You (Smart Apes Dub)A Million Stars (Myon & Shane 54 Summer of Love Mix)Slow To Learn (Maor Levi Club Mix)Punk (Arty Rock-n-Rolla Mix)Save The World (Extended Mix)On The Wire (Dennis Sheperd Remix)Love Comes Again (Hardwell Rework)', b'I said this a long time ago:  I originally thought BT was great; however, as the years progressed, he suddenly decided he could sing.  BIG MISTAKE.  His voice is nothing to write home about.  I enjoyed his earlier CDs where he worked with Jan Johnstone and Kirsty Hawshaw (former lead singer for Opus Three).  However, please note, I am in the MINORITY on this!', b"It took me a little while to figure out this CD.  There are two CD's worth of random tracks, only a few of which are even BT's work.  A lot of them aren't that great.  A few are pretty good.  But then the gold comes at the end when you find the two ~70 minute mixes using the aforementioned tracks.  The mixes are excellent!So basically just listen to the mixes and pick and choose the few standalone tracks that are good on their own.  There's definitely enough good stuff to make it worth its price.", b'BT does it again.As a frequent and avid Laptop Symphony listener, I was more than excited we were getting a full mix album in a similar vein. BT put a lot of time into this mix, and it shows. His transitions are spot on, his famous use of stutter edits and tempo changes are abundant and lively, and the way each mix shows his skills with different genres really makes for a diverse, energetic, and stunning mix.The first "CD" / Mix is similar to the podcast: mostly drumstep / dubstep, with some progressive trance mixed in. It\'s hard hitting, but BT has a lot of fun with it. The second mix is more reminiscient of his older style: more trance / house, and much more intimate and melodic. Both mixes are incredible though, and you get some neat exclusives like the Extended Cut of Save the World and his new edit of Flaming June.A great compilation from one of the best DJs around.', b"Although there are only a select few of the songs that are written and composed by the master himself, then entire album is this legend, once again, at his best.  If you are just getting into the electronic music scene and music, BT is one of its many geniuses who writes, composes, produces, and engineers all of his songs. This is more of a DJ'd compilation of other's work but the selection of songs are very true to his style and play in a way that flows to his fashion.  At first I played it in my living room.  I was not totally impressed with it as I usually am with him, but, after transporting it to my car's system, I fell in love with it all the same.  So it may need a different atmospheric ambiance if at first your ears do not agree with its listening pleasure.  I assure you though, you can never go wrong with anything BT!", b"I don't know how much BT did with the songs on this album as they all have their own artist, but I love the compilation all together. The songs all flow into one another making it a giant long track, all very fun, upbeat, and mildly dubsteppy. I really enjoy it!", b'If you\'ve ever bought a BT CD/release, you know his style of music. His style crosses Dream Music, House and Trance with some unique beats & sounds in between. He has released many songs that give his signature sound. However, not many releases with him mixing, until now. This 2CD set showcases a "new" BT mixing it up. The first CD offers an astounding set of hard Electro & House beats, with a side of dubstep. Very different for BT fans, nonetheless, exciting and fresh! The second CD offers a BT that we know and love. Great vocals & a trance like state that he takes us to. Keep the tracklist near by, because you will be asking yourself "What Song Is This?" every few minutes. Great Job, BT!']}

The box this computer came in says NEW however when I opened it I immediately noticed visible damage to the MacBook case. Not too bad, a couple scratches and a dent. I could have lived with that but when I opened it up the first thing that caught my attention is a 2.5 inch scratch on the screen. That I can't live with, not for this price. To top it off it was dirty, like sand or dirt all over the keyboard...

What we received had been clearly dropped multiple times.  The corners no longer lined up with one being completely crushed.  The damage was obvious and should have been caught by the "inspector" before it passed inspection.  Now we need to return it and hope for the best with the next one.', b'VERY disappointed.  The computer runs fine, but the display hinge is weak and the display flops over if adjusted to much more than 90 degrees from the keyboard.  Apparently, these MacBooks are very susceptible to this problem, and fixing the problem requires major surgery / return to factory.  You would think this problem would be fixed in the "refurbish" process.  Going to return.', b'I am so disappointed!

The product was dented and scratched on the left back corner of the lid, and it loads up with a question mark on the screen. I assume that means it can\xe2\x80\x99t read any operating system, so much for OS X Mavericks. He was so excited when he opened his present, only to be deeply disappointed when getting it out and turning it on.

Avoid the disappointment and buy elsewhere!!!', b'There are some dents and scratches that were not mentioned in the description.

NOT AS DESCRIBED.', b"I was looking for a macbook but I didn't want to spend all of my savings, so I decided to go with a refurbished one. The tiny laptop came with a charger and wasn't even hard to set up. I'll definitely recommend this to a friend looking for a new laptop-- can't even tell that it's used!", b'Definitely used, a lot of dents and scratches. Also not clean and had a lot of finger prints/sticky stuff on the outside. The power cord needs to be replaced due to it "turtlenecking" quite badly.But the computer seems to work just fine.']}

I purchased it entirely for my hobbies and it has more than enough memory and processing power for those (CNC and R/C AIRCRAFT).  I have found the display to be crisp and clear and as an added bonus I found that I get an excellent wifi connection in my shop where my old pc could barely connect.  Yes... it is a bit flimsy compared to higher priced models, but I don't plan to be going any farther than from the house to the shop with it.  For anyone needing a pc that will just be used around the house (maybe a little light travel) this is a nice laptop.  The quad core processor has plenty of power for the typical home and office applications.  The only negative things about it were the shipping time (8 days) and how long it took the windows 10 upgrade to complete.  Other than those 2 negatives, using it has been a pleasure.", b"Great little laptop, needed something lightweight and reasonably priced as my old laptop broke in the middle of the semester (the hinges completely busted, another reason why I chose this model because of the sturdy chrome hinges, if you've had the same problem as me before I would definitely recommend this one if you're worried about that happening again). The only criticism I have is that the speakers are on the bottom of the keyboard part at the front which does affect the sound quality a little bit but if you're not worried about that then there's literally no other problems with it (and if you are then you can just use headphones I guess, the audio quality through headphones is fine). The display is great and Windows 10 works really well on it. All in all, it's a great choice if you're looking for a reasonably priced, reliable laptop.", b"So far so good.  My wife uses it more than me and her opinion seems to lean towards 'not as good as the old one' (same brand).  BUT, the old one is 10+ yrs old! The new one is lighter and thinner.  The drawback is the built in speakers aren't as good because they're, probably, not as big (?).  The mouse pad doesn't have the scroll line on the right and this was something we were very accustomed to.  Performance hasn't really been an issue; only that it 'feels' different.  It connects to our wi-fi quite nicely and has a good display.", b'Not as fast as I expected. My old HP AMD A6 processor seems to be just as fast as this one with a 2017 Quad Core processor. The picture quality is better though. I needed a new computer and wanted to stick with HP and new features like Blue Tooth. I am happy with this purchase.', b'It has all the criteria I was searching for.  I have an IT friend who suggested most of the criteria, this fit the bill. Then I transferred all my old items over which turned out to be quite simple.  Except a few games.  I only wish I had looked for one with a back-lit keyboard as I do not always have an abundance of lighting turned on in the evenings.', b'for basic and a little more it is ok, I only use it for basic, shows and movies, but if you have to many windows open, it is slow', b"This computer does the basics I guess, so far it runs pretty slow and I have notice it's slow to respond to commands. When I click on things it takes a couple seconds for it to catch up, same with typing. All in all it's an ok computer just wish I would have paid way less for what I actually got.", b'I received this laptop on January 9, 2018. Today is May 15, 2018 and the hard drive started clicking and the computer is dead.  I am deeply disappointed. I would prefer to speak with Amazon or with the supplier, but it seems that window is closed.  4 months and then total death is unacceptable.  I would give 0 stars if I could.']}

It's not MacBook Pro, but it can really hold its own, and it's about one tenth of the price. I've tried other netbook-type devices in the past and they always had such limitations. This device operates just like a laptop, and allows the full functionality of MS Office, plays videos just fine, and allows for general Internet activities with decent performance and reliability. The keyboard is easy to type on, the screen is decent, it's lightweight yet feels fairly sturdy, and it's a device that just grows on you. After I first fired it up, I wasn't super impressed, but after using it a while, I am starting to really love it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants something for email, web surfing, watching videos, or even the full functionality of Word and Excel if you're a student or want to keep track of your finances.", b'Cute and small fits perfectly in my handbag. This product is decent for everyday simple office work and travel', b'it does everything my Dell D630 did only better with w/10  Screen is only an inch smaller each side its fast, prints and so far does it all that I could want in a notebook', b'The Lenovo Ideapad 110s is 2017\xe2\x80\x99s answer to dirt cheap laptops from Lenovo. It\xe2\x80\x99s only about $150 to buy, runs a full copy of Windows 10, hardly weighs anything, and has a nice keyboard \xe2\x80\x93 but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly have the highest-end specs.The Lenovo IdeaPad 110s is the budget follow-up to last year\xe2\x80\x99s 100s. This time they\xe2\x80\x99ve upgraded from an Intel Atom processor to a full Celeron, 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard flash storage. You still have the basic plastic shell body, 11.6\xe2\x80\x9d 1366x768 TN screen with poor viewing angles, but decent quality straight on, and the full fold-out-to-flat hinges. But this time you get lower battery life, which is kind of a bummer.This is a laptop that\xe2\x80\x99s perfect for a super budget school or travel writing laptop, but nothing more. The Intel Celeron processor, while likely to handle multitasking a little better, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really bring any new performance over last year\xe2\x80\x99s model. In fact, the laptop scored lower on Google\xe2\x80\x99s Octane benchmark than the 100s! It is worth noting that Octane is being retired by Google.Also last year\xe2\x80\x99s model only came with N wifi, which is much slower than the current generation AC wireless standard. The new 110s has AC, though it\xe2\x80\x99s only a 1x1 antenna.The 110s has a responsive and comfortable keyboard for long typing sessions. No numpad, but keys are appropriately arranged and spaced out for its size. Very easy to use. The screen is still nice and crisp for working in word, Google docs, or web browsing.But you won\xe2\x80\x99t get a ton more out of this machine. No Photoshop design work, no video editing, nothing like that.The webcam is trash.The speakers are on the bottom. They\xe2\x80\x99re stereo this time, instead of last year\xe2\x80\x99s mono, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not great.This time, the whole computer is just white. This is, theoretically, a more aesthetically neutral position to be in, but the solid white keyboard and hand rest are bound to start turning colors and looking pretty gross after a few months. I would not look forward to that.As far as media consumption goes, this is actually a pretty good machine. Via USB 3.0 external hard drive, I was able to smoothly play back 4k 60fps video files, 1080p 60fps video files, and a full raw BluRay rip MKV in the native Windows 10 Movies app with no hiccups. 8k proved to be a bit much for it, though.On YouTube, I was able to play back 1080p60, 1440p, and 4K with no dropped frames.But there are still plenty of moments when the computer becomes unresponsive or just downright sluggish to use. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little Celeron with a mere 2GB of RAM - and that can only do so much. Now, you do have a full copy of Windows 10 on here, which adds a little flexibility over something like a Chromebook or something, and I feel it may be one of the last of its kind with Windows 10 S coming soon.If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a sub-$200 laptop for basic office work, web browsing, and media consumption - the Lenovo 110s might be for you. It features a couple upgrades from last year\xe2\x80\x99s 100s, and is still tiny and super lightweight.', b"Not going to lie 95% of the reviews had me worried. However mine showed up on time, with everything working. I've had no issues, it's perfect for all the simple things I need it for.", b"This laptop is amazing I recommend for everything don't listen to all the other reviews saying it stops working I have had for about 1 month and it still works it's fast and doesn't lag in games", b'fantastic little laptop. really looking forward to using it for classes and internet use. Great battery life so far.']}
{'asin': 'B000S5CABO', 'title': 'The Laptop Ep by MC Lars on Amazon Music - Amazon.com', 'price': '', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b"One of the last CDs I've ever bought.", b'i got turned to mc lars years ago and have just started collecting the cds would rebuy for sure =)', b'Whether you call it post-punk-laptop-rap or just plain good, MC Lars is the most underrated rapper out there, and probably the most original. In probably his first major EP, MC Lars lays it out on the table in all his geeky/fun glory. Since it\'s independently produced, it is a bit rough and sounds like a demo. "iGeneration" and "Signing Emo" are later found on his semi-major label debut, and they mostly sound the same. Songs like "Hurricane Fresh," "UK Vise Versa" and "Straight Outta Stockholm" are great indie rap, and entertaining to boot. "Mr. Raven" on the other hand is not only great indie rap, but an excellent rap track period. Dare I say it\'s MC Lars\' best? Perfectly incorporating Edgar Allen Poe\'s famous poem, it kicks the beats, brings the cool, and MC Lars lays it down, scaring the crap out of all comers. Overall, while the project isn\'t MC Lars\' overall strongest, it does contain some great tracks. So if you haven\'t the Lars, then lay down your cash for The Laptop EP, which is slightly less expensive then a laptop.', b'Lars has a new album coming out soon, and he recently put all the MP3s from his first release under his current specific moniker up on his website for download. So uh, I downloaded them.  It\'s a seven-song EP, although two also appear on The Graduate.  They mark a big step in production value from Radio Pet Fencing, and the starting point for the repertoire he uses now when performing live.  There\'s some solid beats and catchy choruses to be found, and some interesting sampling and experimenting with other genres.  I have to appreciate a rapper who will do a track about Edgar Allen Poe in front of a guitar riff from a Brand New song.  "Signing Emo" is probably one of his most popular songs, and has some clever lyrics along with a chorus from a fake punk band that managed to fool some people into trying to book them.  "iGeneration" and "Hurricane Fresh" are also both songs sampling rock bands that are popular live.  "Stat-60" is less commonly heard but gives Lars definite nerd cred for rhyming about math class, and "Straight Outta Stockholm" is a self-aggrandizing rap but with a nice sound to it, encapsulating well Lars\' attitude and outlook.  The Laptop EP is a really quick and enjoyable lesson, and there\'s no reason not to listen when he\'s giving it to you for free.', b'OK, you\'ve got to be wondering: who exactly is MC Lars? Well MC Lars is definitley one of the freshest new artists you\'re going to hear this year. In fact, he\'s Hurricane Fresh. Using beats he made on his laptop and various instruments he had lying around, MC Lars has crafted one of the most clever and original recordings I\'ve heard in a long time. He drops more pop culture references than a month of VH1\'s "Best Week Ever" and anyone who can incorporate Edgar Allan Poe\'s "The Raven" with the Brand New song "Okay I Believe You But My Tommy Gun Don\'t" is nothing short of a genius. The rhymes on every song are extremely tight and there is nothing elementary about anything here. Lars has what most MCs out there now lack: brains. You\'ll listen to some lines over and over just to grasp the full hilarity of them. The highlight for me is the sublime "Signing Emo" which chronicles the rise and fall of fictional emo band Hearts That Hate, complete with a chorus by said band that is rife with more emo cliches than the entire Drive-Thru Records catalog. I almost split a gut the first time I heard it. Trust me on this, if you enjoy anything about music and can appreciate a rhyme of any kind you will not be dissapointed. The only downside here is that there are only seven songs, but since there is no filler, it\'s worth the price. Who\'s house? Raven\'s House!', b'MC Lars I find to be a bit of an enigma.On this EP, he basically has a big laugh at what he sees around him, mostly pop culture, for example the hilarity of the music biz, with a faux (or is it?) criticism of the overpopularization of emo ("Singing Emo"), the difficulty of his statistics class on "Stat-60" ("Chi-squared values all the time.../Why\'d you have to go and make things so complicated, Professor Thomas?"), US-UK relations on "UK Visa Versa," and the hypocrisy of nonconformists on "Hurricane Fresh."But what is his purpose? These are all rightfully funny on their own, but there\'s no real theme to this EP. It ultimately reads like a C-grade senior thesis? Did he ever take Expository Writing 101? Ultimately, it may not matter, as the knowingly cheesy delivery from Lars skips convincingly over minimal beats. He\'s trying to convince us he\'s keeping it real - so if he is a college-degree earning toker, this CD will make a lot of sense to you.The standout track must be "iGeneration," which triumphs the cultural shift (no longer Generation Y?) created by the DIY mentality of the use of iPods. The beats here are programmed guitars with a buzzy kazoo-ish noise. Good stuff.', b"When I first heard MC Lars at a special concert in Oxford, England, I was practically rolling on the floor in laughter. MC is a pretty good rapper, but his writing skills are what make him excellent. As a former Oxford student, and current Stanford student, MC is super smart, and that shows through in the songs. Take Rapbeth for instance; it's a rap about the three witches from Macbeth. Another great song is Signing Emo, following the career of an emo band brought into existence simply because they were emo, and emo is hot right now. The songs are all really catchy! They're super funny, and well worth my $7.99."]}

After I remove the battery I can get it to power on, but there's no notification that the battery has reached its end of life. I've purchased some Dell Latitudes on Amazon before and after I purchased this device, and I think I'll stick with those.Bottom line: When this machine is working it's a sufficient machine, but when it has trouble I want to throw it out the window. I would give it a lower star rating, but in the interest of being fair I'm giving it a 3 because when it worked I had no complaints. Maybe I got a lemon.", b"This is the fastest laptop I've had up to now. Every thing worked fine on it. The one I got looks brand new. There was one corner that had the silver finish not covering the whitish plastic cover material. I couldn't tell if that was from wear and rubbed off from having been carried in a bag or if Dell just missed it at the factory. No big thing.Thanks to Computer Express for a great refurbished laptop. Their communication during shipping was fantastic.I did replace the 4gb with two 8gb Crucial modules and the 8460p picked it up with no issues.", b"My laptop came from ComputerExpress. Webcam, mic, wireless, everything works perfectly. Windows 7 patched flawlessly and the free windows 10 upgrade is available. 9/10 for condition. Minimal wear. Battery fully charges to 100%. Everything listed was also included in the box. They did a great job of packing it as well. I couldn't be happier with this seller. I bought this as a secondary computer and had originally intended to upgrade the ram from 4 gigs to 8 but it easily runs multiple programs as is. For daily online use it's perfect! 5 *'s!", b"Man, what a great deal. Came with Windows Something pre-installed, and quickly upgraded to Windows 10 after a few restarts. Windows still has the best selection of software IMO, but now with fewer security issues, which I am hugely thankful for after several trips to Linux-land. Lots of storage space, good processing speed, and good RAM. Looked pretty darn good out of the box.Downsides: I don't think it has a graphics card, because my graphics-intensive software (Blender, Unity, etc.) tends to slow down a bit when I'm using them. Don't quote me on that because laptops this old sometimes do have graphics cards, but the cards are just so outdated that you can't tell whether they are or aren't in use half the time. The 4 USB ports are probably compensation for the crappy trackpad and lack of volume control buttons. My model has less than 4 hours of battery life, but I keep it plugged in anyway so I can't complain.Overall, a perfect deal for someone totally broke and tired of reinstalling Linux. This customer is happy.", b'It might be a refurbished, but so far I am very pleased, everything works as advertised. Computer Express took the time to contact me directly and asked if I wanted Windows 7 or 10, and then they shipped it out right away. I am thinking of buying another one just for my photography to store pictures, etc.', b'This laptop Rocks fast easy to use. It was the best deal I could find for speed and software was installed ready to go. simple setup took 10 minutes. Thank you for a really good buy and fast HP', b"I've been using this model for work and it is a well built business laptop with a good keyboard and display.  The item received was an 8470p which has the next generation chip (and had been built just less than two years ago per the HP support website).  Very reliable, great to use at home on a docking station.  I will say, these are heavy.  Battery tends to be good for 2 years, OK for 3, and really needing replacement at 4."]}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

It's not MacBook Pro, but it can really hold its own, and it's about one tenth of the price. I've tried other netbook-type devices in the past and they always had such limitations. This device operates just like a laptop, and allows the full functionality of MS Office, plays videos just fine, and allows for general Internet activities with decent performance and reliability. The keyboard is easy to type on, the screen is decent, it's lightweight yet feels fairly sturdy, and it's a device that just grows on you. After I first fired it up, I wasn't super impressed, but after using it a while, I am starting to really love it, and would recommend it to anyone who wants something for email, web surfing, watching videos, or even the full functionality of Word and Excel if you're a student or want to keep track of your finances.", b'Cute and small fits perfectly in my handbag. This product is decent for everyday simple office work and travel', b'it does everything my Dell D630 did only better with w/10  Screen is only an inch smaller each side its fast, prints and so far does it all that I could want in a notebook', b'The Lenovo Ideapad 110s is 2017\xe2\x80\x99s answer to dirt cheap laptops from Lenovo. It\xe2\x80\x99s only about $150 to buy, runs a full copy of Windows 10, hardly weighs anything, and has a nice keyboard \xe2\x80\x93 but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly have the highest-end specs.The Lenovo IdeaPad 110s is the budget follow-up to last year\xe2\x80\x99s 100s. This time they\xe2\x80\x99ve upgraded from an Intel Atom processor to a full Celeron, 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard flash storage. You still have the basic plastic shell body, 11.6\xe2\x80\x9d 1366x768 TN screen with poor viewing angles, but decent quality straight on, and the full fold-out-to-flat hinges. But this time you get lower battery life, which is kind of a bummer.This is a laptop that\xe2\x80\x99s perfect for a super budget school or travel writing laptop, but nothing more. The Intel Celeron processor, while likely to handle multitasking a little better, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really bring any new performance over last year\xe2\x80\x99s model. In fact, the laptop scored lower on Google\xe2\x80\x99s Octane benchmark than the 100s! It is worth noting that Octane is being retired by Google.Also last year\xe2\x80\x99s model only came with N wifi, which is much slower than the current generation AC wireless standard. The new 110s has AC, though it\xe2\x80\x99s only a 1x1 antenna.The 110s has a responsive and comfortable keyboard for long typing sessions. No numpad, but keys are appropriately arranged and spaced out for its size. Very easy to use. The screen is still nice and crisp for working in word, Google docs, or web browsing.But you won\xe2\x80\x99t get a ton more out of this machine. No Photoshop design work, no video editing, nothing like that.The webcam is trash.The speakers are on the bottom. They\xe2\x80\x99re stereo this time, instead of last year\xe2\x80\x99s mono, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not great.This time, the whole computer is just white. This is, theoretically, a more aesthetically neutral position to be in, but the solid white keyboard and hand rest are bound to start turning colors and looking pretty gross after a few months. I would not look forward to that.As far as media consumption goes, this is actually a pretty good machine. Via USB 3.0 external hard drive, I was able to smoothly play back 4k 60fps video files, 1080p 60fps video files, and a full raw BluRay rip MKV in the native Windows 10 Movies app with no hiccups. 8k proved to be a bit much for it, though.On YouTube, I was able to play back 1080p60, 1440p, and 4K with no dropped frames.But there are still plenty of moments when the computer becomes unresponsive or just downright sluggish to use. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little Celeron with a mere 2GB of RAM - and that can only do so much. Now, you do have a full copy of Windows 10 on here, which adds a little flexibility over something like a Chromebook or something, and I feel it may be one of the last of its kind with Windows 10 S coming soon.If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a sub-$200 laptop for basic office work, web browsing, and media consumption - the Lenovo 110s might be for you. It features a couple upgrades from last year\xe2\x80\x99s 100s, and is still tiny and super lightweight.', b"Not going to lie 95% of the reviews had me worried. However mine showed up on time, with everything working. I've had no issues, it's perfect for all the simple things I need it for.", b"This laptop is amazing I recommend for everything don't listen to all the other reviews saying it stops working I have had for about 1 month and it still works it's fast and doesn't lag in games", b'fantastic little laptop. really looking forward to using it for classes and internet use. Great battery life so far.']}

Windows still has the best selection of software IMO, but now with fewer security issues, which I am hugely thankful for after several trips to Linux-land. Lots of storage space, good processing speed, and good RAM. Looked pretty darn good out of the box.Downsides: I don't think it has a graphics card, because my graphics-intensive software (Blender, Unity, etc.) tends to slow down a bit when I'm using them. Don't quote me on that because laptops this old sometimes do have graphics cards, but the cards are just so outdated that you can't tell whether they are or aren't in use half the time. The 4 USB ports are probably compensation for the crappy trackpad and lack of volume control buttons.

It was the best deal I could find for speed and software was installed ready to go. simple setup took 10 minutes. Thank you for a really good buy and fast HP', b"I've been using this model for work and it is a well built business laptop with a good keyboard and display.  The item received was an 8470p which has the next generation chip (and had been built just less than two years ago per the HP support website).  Very reliable, great to use at home on a docking station.  I will say, these are heavy.  Battery tends to be good for 2 years, OK for 3, and really needing replacement at 4."]}

They are working to address my concerns.Further update:  the mfg was very concerned about the problem.  They sent me a replacement at no charge.  The replacement was a new model.  The power cord was no longer wired directly to the fans. Instead it connects to one of the two usb ports.  I feel this will correct the issue with the cord pulling loose.The fans cool well.  I am very pleased with the focus the mfg has for customer satisfaction.  I am changing my rating to 5 stars.", b'This thing is working great.It\'s quiet.It kicks a pretty good breeze.I only use one at a time...there\'s some buttons on the back, you can select all or only some of the fans.I alternate back & forth between the two so that I extend the life but half is more than enough to keep my beast of a laptop cool.I\'m using a 17" that heats up like hellhound when I\'m running games & video, even with the three onboard fans.So this cooling pad does exactly what I need it to do and only using half its resources at a time!', b"***UPDATE***Kootek contacted me regarding my experience with the product and offered me a full refund, in which I received a few days after.  Even though this product did not meet my needs nor fit my laptop, see review below, the customer service was the best it could be. I will definitely purchase more products from Kootek as they stand by their word when it comes to customer satisfaction.  Very great company!!!This does not fit a 17 inch laptop.  I have a 17.3 inch laptop and it hangs off of the side of this thing about an inch on each side and about a half inch in the back.  In regards to using it as just a stand, it's solid.  Very well built and sturdy and the metal leg is pretty strong... so speaking from that aspect it works great as a stand.  In regards to it's ability to cool a laptop. ehhh it's pretty garbage.  The fan speed is way too slow to pump enough air into the bottom of the machine.  My laptop fans starve when they get above 50% speed... it's like the stand fans aren't moving enough air into my laptop and it sounds my like my laptop is making the stand fans work faster just from begging for more air.  My laptop actually runs cooler with the fans turned off.  Good looking product, great feel and it is very sturdy... but the fans do nothing but take up a USB port and make my machine run hotter.I'm using an Eluktronics PA71 17.3 inch gaming laptop with a GTX 1070 and a i7-7700Hq processor. It's a 17.3 inch Clevo chasis, which is used in various other brands of gaming laptops.  I would try to find something a little bigger for anything over a 15inch laptop.I may return this just because I can get a laptop stand for half the price.  I'll give it another week or so.", b'This review comes after one month of using the Kootek Laptop Cooling Pad 12"-17" Cooler Pad.As far as I can tell, when I turn on both buttons (activating all of the fans), this unit can cool my CPU and GPU from 1-3 degrees Fahrenheit, which feels significant as you approach higher temperature. The adjustable and lockable angle is a nice feature when moving from surface to surface. The unit does not seem to affect power drain significantly, as I haven\'t noticed a significant drop in battery life when I use the pad vs. when I\'m not using the pad.The light is a nice aesthetic feature, not strong enough to illuminate much. That said, I do wish one of the buttons turned the light off.I bought this for a heavier laptop unit, and the only complaint I have is that the base frame can feel weak if you\'re lifting it from the base only, as if it was going to snap. Make sure you lift it carefully if you have a weighty laptop.Overall, I\'m quite satisfied with this product. I\'ll update my review as appropriate if I run into any longevity issues.']}

It worked for a week or so.  Another two hours on the phone.  Seriously.  The next call was perhaps the worst.  The tech said, "Since you don\'t want to humimth your computer......." and a 100 words more before I could ask what I didn\'t want to do.  Then she started talking about the "accident" and "broken keys.." I asked what accident? What broken keys?  I don\'t know if she got my case mixed up with another or was establishing a claim that I\'d damaged the computer in some way.']}

Graphics are decent and the speed is incredible! plays Fortnite like a dream!", b'I never write a review when everything is fine with a product I buy, but had to write this one. Figured I\xe2\x80\x99d get this laptop & it would look used but was surprised how new it looks! No nicks, dents or scratches. Very clean. Fired right up , followed directions & it\xe2\x80\x99s working great.', b'Happy with the laptop. Arrived unbelievably fast. Think it was 48 hours. Booted right up. Left it running for two weeks to burn in. All features working. No complaints.', b'Great computer but it will lag/freeze.  Also, not sure but I thought MS office was included, it is now asking for me to by something. For the price it works great.  I will check with the company on the lag/freeze issue.']}

I was looking for a neoprene sleeve that would fit snug around the now smaller in size 15-inch MacBook Pro.  This is the solution.  Fits like it was made for it, no slop side-to-side or top-to-bottom. It is a good quality case with a well constructed body, decent padding on the sides and a excellent zipper.', b'This sleeve is awesome for the price. I was looking for a sleeve to fit my new XPS 13 9343 and was having trouble because it has a 13.3 inch screen but is only a 12 inch in size due to the infinity display. It seemed that most 13 inch laptop sleeves would have an extra inch length wise and I didn\'t want the laptop to be loose inside the sleeve.A few reviews mentioned that the XPS 13 did fit for them but there were no pictures for me too look at. I took a chance by purchasing the 11.6 inch sleeve for it and put the laptop in for the first time just now and it fits like a glove! It fits perfectly inside the sleeve with no room to move around, which is what I like.The case itself has decent soft padding with a sleek black look, with "Amazon basics" labeled on one side. I love Amazon so I don\'t like showing off their products :)The only thing is that when you zip up the sleeve with the XPS 13 inside, you have to be careful zipping around the corners because they stick out a little bit, but once you have it zipped up, the laptop sleeve fits it perfectly and the laptop sits nice and snug.', b'This will protect your laptop from the inside of your other bag, but not from being dropped. When you drop your laptop, it will probably land on a corner, whether you carry it in a sleeve alone or inside another bag. Unfortunately, this sleeve doesn\'t really protect the corners. It\'s padded enough on the "faces", and the corners covered by the zipper have this grosgrain hem (between the neoprene and the zipper) which affords a little cushioning. The story is not as good for corners opposite the zipper: if your laptop pokes between the two inner hems around the edge, then you only have a thin, unpadded layer of fabric at those two corners. When I push into these with my hand, I feel the sharp corner of my laptop. An edge wrap of high-density foam would fix this and deliver much better drop protection.Fit is OK for a Lenovo Thinkpad T450s, though not "perfect" as other reviewers claim, it\'s a little loose in the "up/down" direction (looking at the main product picture). Nobody seems to make a sleeve specifically for modern Thinkpads, but the T450s has similar dimensions to a 13" Macbook, so I may try out a Macbook sleeve.Finally, why don\'t more laptop sleeves zip open at the narrow side of the laptop? Most backpacks accept a laptop in the "portrait" orientation, so a narrow-side zipper would let you retrieve and stow your computer without removing the sleeve from your backpack.', b"Not sure how I feel about this sleeve. On one hand it does everything it needs to but on the other, the zipper scratches both top and bottom my Dell XPS 15 9560. This happens on both sides of my laptop so its not just the zipper head but the zipper teeth as well. Now, the scratching is limited to only the area that is around the left and right corners of the zipper and yes, I did have the cloth overhang (underneath the zipper teeth) pulled on top of the laptop before I zippered it shut.The images that I uploaded are taken on my Samsung S7 so I apologize in advance that the quality might make it difficult to make out the scratches.On another note, the sleeve seems to have a few strands of thread loose from the first day I got it. They haven't spread in the 2 weeks I've own the product but something to note for a brand new sleeve.Also, cut out the plastic tags within the sleeve as that causes wear on your laptop (though minimally) and makes it easier for the threads holding the tags on to tear and pull more thread from the sleeve with it.Some modifications I made to the sleeve is that I put a small piece of tennis over grip over the underside of the zipper head to prevent it from further roughing up my expensive laptop. (I will upload images of this) How I got the tennis over grip to stick was by attaching it with double sided phone repair tape that I bought off eBay. I bought the kind that was black and not clear; I find that the clear double sided tape has very weak adhesive that does not bond well to multiple things as I use my double sided tape for various applications other than repairing phones.If you're the owner of a Dell XPS 15, I don't recommend this product if you wish to keep your machine in 100% like new condition.", b'The sizing information was wrong in the description.  I purchased the 13.3" version.  Description states internal dimensions at 13" x 9.5".  My iPad Pro with keyboard cover is 12.5" x 9.25" and wouldn\'t fit.  I have included photos of the foam that was packed in the sleeve which measures 12.5" x 9.125".  The foam was a tight fit and really reflects the actual size of the device you could fit inside.  The corners of the sleeve have a large radius as other reviewers have stated so be careful if your device has more "square" corners.  Based on the price, I\'m sure there are some manufacturing tolerances that may account for sizing issues.  My advice is buy a size up if your device is very close to the given size specs.  I\'ll give it 2 stars based on price and quality had it been sized correctly.']}

I originally planned on buying a mouse because I typically don't like trackpads, but this one is pretty good! The battery life isn't fantastic, even in battery saver mode, but that's not an issue for me, but something to keep in mind if it is for you.Another thing I love is the keyboard. It lights up, but dims down if you're not using it for a while. Great for if you're watching videos. Lights right back up if you start typing or touch the mousepad.Basically this laptop is everything I needed, and even what I wanted, for a hell of a deal. Don't count this one out if the downsides don't bother you. (Not the best battery life, probably not super powerful, but I played Overwatch and Dragon Age 3 on it really well, no lagging, skipping or even fans kicking into overdrive) and it's surprisingly light! Probably the lightest laptop I've ever had to be honest.", b"This is a basic gaming laptop and it runs modern games med/high details at 1080p, 30-60fps.  Unfortunately, you won't get that out of the box.  At least I didn't.  The laptop comes installed with Radeon 17.1.1 drivers, which does not seem to support the GPU included (Mine is listed as a RX 560).  This results in games running using the APU graphics instead.  You must use the number on the bottom of the laptop on the Dell support site to access the product page to download the updated bios, which will support Radeon 18.2.1 drivers.  With the new bios and drivers installed, you will then need to bring up Radeon Settings and under System Settings, select Switchable Graphics and set games to run in High Performance Mode.  The game will then utilize the GPU and you will get performance close to a RX 460.The laptop performs well.  Applications will run using the APU graphics to save power, and you have the option to run heavier applications using the GPU.  It is a nice setup once you get it working.  I may give this product 5-stars, but that is because I was able to set it up.  It is clear that youtube reviewers did not enable the GPU, so their performance tests do not give a good indication of the performance of this laptop.", b'I will preface this review by saying I\'m not extremely versed in computers, far from it. I don\'t know a lot about them and my brother actually picked out this laptop for me. Before I received this laptop, I had been using an Acer Aspire from 3 years ago that had cost $250 New. In comparison to my acer, this laptop is amazing. It took less than half the amount of time to do all the updates on the Dell, download origin and steam and download all my games and dlc as it did to just download 3 games on my acer. The speaker is very nice quality, I usually listen to music on my phone because the speakers were better than my acer, now my phone is inferior. The graphics of my games are very much improved too. I would consider myself a casual gamer, I don\'t play "tons" of games and the most expansive game I play in regards to graphics and world size is Dragon Age inquisition. However, all the gameplay is now less glitchy with movement and a much clearer picture. This may not be the "computer nerd\'s" laptop or meant for an extremely serious pc gamer, but I\'m very happy with my purchase.', b"Great gaming laptop, but the driver they included had a update that screwed with it, which requires it to be manually adjusted. I recommend taking it to someone who knows how to do that if you want to play anything on it. Otherwise, it runs great!Basically, you need to uninstall the old graphics drivers entirely. Reinstall the new AMD driver (v18.0+), and tell it to not keep the system up to date, cause it'd install an inferior version once you restart your pc.", b'Great entry-level gaming laptop! I bought mine refurbished for $500 and it came in pristine condition! The package had tracking and came in a day early!As for appearance, the laptop is very pleasing to the eye. The red and black is very nice. The red back-light is also very handy when in darker conditions. Comes with a number pad which is a plus. I have seen reviews where the keyboard seems to be very flexible but that is not the case. The keyboard is very solid and the mouse-pad is well-crafted with good tracking.The screen is pretty flexible but that is not a big problem. I have seen people throw a lot of shade towards the screen and the quality but it is fine as long as you are looking dead at it. It is an anti-glare screen so it makes sense.As for performance, the laptop seems to handle anything I throw at it. I bought this laptop for video-editing and actually being able to use Elgato HD60 and it does those things easily. The MX 460 is pretty capable. It is able to play most games on low-medium settings. I got constant 30 fps on Fortnite with medium settings.Pros:- 3 USB ports, HDMI, SD card slot, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and ethernet port- Nice red and black theme- Backlit keyboard- Number pad- Gaming performance on low-medium settings with more graphically-intense games- Decent battery life. Usually around 4 hours of just surfing the web and 1-2 hours gaming and watching videos.Cons:- Its a little heavy, not easy to hold with one hand and barely squeezes in my backpack. Still not that bulky though.- Starting was a little bit of a struggle for me, the laptop repeatedly froze and I had to force restart but this stopped happening after the 1st day. (I think this was just a problem with mine)- Dual fans get a little loud when gaming.- Power adapter is pretty bigIn conclusion, GREAT budget gaming laptop very satisfied with this product and I recommend it to anyone who wants a laptop that is capable.']}

I bought this to replace an older, aging Asus ROG laptop and I absolutely love using it! It starts up fast, plays all my games great, and is nearly half the weight of my old gaming laptop! The fingerprint scanner works every time and is a much appreciated addition to the computer. The keyboard deck is a firm aluminum, which makes typing and using the laptop in normal use feel very premium, despite the rest of the chassis being made of plastic, though the plastic certainly does not feel cheap. The computer has a very professional look to it with a hint of that gamer charm in the red accents and keyboard. I personally find it to be a very tasteful and minimalist design, as opposed to the more flashy gaming laptops on the market, though others may disagree.The screen is great for most uses, however it can seem a bit washed out in some areas and when it goes black you can see some backlight bleed around the camera. Other than that, it works just fine for everyday use and gaming, and I don't have any issues with viewing angles. Speaking of angles, however, the screen does not bend back very far. For use on a desk or table this won't be too much of an issue, but on your lap or propped up against your knees while laying down in bed, this can present some awkward viewing positions where you're looking above the screen, rather than directly at it. I don't have a huge issue with this, but others might.The keyboard feels very tactile and easy to type on. Keystrokes are smooth and consistent and the WASD keys have a nice outline to them, further accenting the gaming aspects of this laptop. The keys seem to have a bit of a hollow, plasticky feel to them, but this does not detract from the experience unless you're the nitpicky type. I have not had any issues using this keyboard thus far.The trackpad could be better, but it's not horrible. I was a little spoiled to the higher end trackpad of my ROG with the smooth glass feel, so coming to the textured plastic feel of this Inspiron is different. Precision is rather good and gestures work with no issues.As far as sound is concerned the computer is silent during light use, such as web browsing and even watching YouTube. When I played Metal Gear Solid V, the fans kicked in but were not that loud or distracting. However, jumping over to PUBG, the fans went into overdrive, presumably because that game is much more processing intensive. You'll want to invest in a good set of headphones if you don't like to hear fans mixed in with your game sound.Speaking of sound, the internal speakers are good for the price point. They are not the best and a better set of external speakers or a good set of headphones will be much better. The internal speakers, even maxed out, seem a little quiet. For normal use they'll get the job done, but you'll probably want headphones of your own.The GeForce GTX1060 6GB packed into this machine has played whatever game I throw at it, from Fallout 4 to PUBG, at a consistent 60 frames per second. Even on battery the laptop can handle gaming, if at lower graphics settings and for a rather short 1 hour of playtime. Like any gaming laptop, you'll want to keep this one plugged in to play. Battery life, otherwise, has been hovering around 4-5 hours before needing a charge, a marked improvement for me over my ROG, which could barely hold 2 hours before dying.TL;DR: You're not going to find another laptop at this price point that delivers what this one does. I paid $899 for mine, the other laptop I was looking at was the Acer Predator Helios 300, which packs a more powerful processor but does not have the SSD and HDD included, only the SSD. I would have had to pay another $50-60 for an additional HDD, along with the $1000 price tag of the Helios. This Dell saved me nearly $200 and delivers all the performance I need without needing to buy more stuff along with it. If you're looking for a gaming laptop that won't break the bank while delivering excellent performance, this is the one to get.", b'We are a gaming family. Every one of us plays video games. When my son needed a laptop for a very conservative college, I started looking for one that had to meed the following criteria.At least an i5 to handle the new wave of games that require 4 cores.At least an high 9-family NVidia GPU to handle the gamesAt least 1 T HD to hold the games and all the class workSome version of an SDD for guick booting in classIt can\'t be covered in red/flashing lights/HUGE logos - it needs to blend in with all the other boring college laptops for non-gamersThis Laptop met all the criteria and even exceeded the GPU requirement - thereby future-proofing if until he\'s in grad school. Moreover, it did that in a package that has an excellent keyboard, great screen rez and it blends in with the other mundane laptops. Too many gaming laptops look like they were designed with 13 year old boys in mind. Lots of red. Lots of lights. They scream "I AM A GAMING LAPTOP...LOOK AT ME!!" Instead of sending him to college with one of those, I opted to get him something that he can open in any class and get zero notice. (The only "gaming" thing about it - aside from the specs - is that the keyboard is backlit red. It will stay red because it literally can not be changed. And that\'s fine as a red keyboard is easy on the eyes in a darkened dorm room where the room-mate might be sleeping.)My son has loaded his games on it, including some very demanding FPS\'s and it handles all of them without any problem (very respectable FPS). There are cheaper laptops to be had, but none of them have this level of performance. I would have expected to pay another $400 for a laptop with these specs. Some of the higher-priced ones might have an i7...but I build gaming PCs and know that - unless someone is playing a game while also running a half-dozen computing intensive programs in the background - there\'s not much to be gained from them.I tested some of the aforementioned cheaper laptops with the 960M GPUs and they run today\'s games well. My concern is a few years down the road. The GPU in this buys us a few more years of use. Take a look at this if you are looking for a sub-1k gaming laptop.', b"Fast overall, good graphics performance. Upgraded the memory and replaced the HDD with a SSD, one screw to remove and the bottom comes off. The memory and hard drive are easily accessible, the replacements took about 15 minutes to install. Overall, very satisfied with this machine. By the way, the 128GB SSD is a SK Hynix M.2, I may replace that eventually, I've only had it for about ten days.Okay review update time. I still love this machine, it's a little slow on battery but holds a charge well when using the Intel graphics adapter. I highly recommend the purchase, you won't be disappointed.", b"Love it. Screen is great, boots fast. Despite being advertised with 8Gb of RAM, mine came with 16. The NVidia 1060 plays the most demanding games with great fps rates. No flickr, no lag. The wireless card is excellent. I have Spectrum 100Mb internet, and there is very little dropoff from ethernet to wifi. I consistenly acheive 100Mb on wifi, and about 110-115 on ethernet. The wifi connection is rock solid, which may be due in part to the Motorola MG 7315 Wifi Modem I have. So far, this machine has performed flawlessly for me. The build quality is excellent. For the price, I don't believe you can find a more well-configured machine."]}

There really is not much to not like about this notebook.The upgrades I can find on this notebook over the ASUS VivoBook E403SA-US21 are the N4200 processor, upgraded ac wireless card (AC 7265), and fingerprint sensor. The NA uses the Apollo Lake chipset and the SA uses the Braswell chipset. Using AIDA64 I compared components on the newer NA to older SA version and many of the components are the same. They use the same 128 GB eMMC drive (SanDisk DF4128), same screen (INNOLUX N140HGE-EAA), and same ram (Micron). The N4200 processor in the NA does significantly increase performance over the N3700 in the SA version of notebook. The N4200 was introduced about 17 months after N3700. The base speed of the N4200 is 1.1 GHz vs. 1.6 GHz of the N3700. This a good thing because it consumes less energy when running at lowest speed. The Turbo speed of the N4200 is 2.5 GHz while the N3700 is 2.4 GHz. The GPU in the N4200 also varies frequency from 200 - 750 MHz while the N3700 GPU varies frequency from 400 - 700 MHz. The GPU on the N4200 also upgrades execution units to 18 over the 16 on the N3700. When looking at benchmarks of these CPUs at CPUBoss and CPUmonkey the performance is significantly better with the N4200. Geekbench 3 multi-core score with N4200 was 72% higher than N3700. Cinebench R11.5 GPU score was 86% higher on N4200. Real world experience using both side by side is that the newer NA performs significantly better than the SA.Pros:* Very nice design. Stylish.* Great physical size and weight. Nicely thin and weighs about what some lighter 13" notebooks weigh.* Very good build quality. Nice aluminum lid and notebook feels solid.* Fingerprint sensor is a nice addition.* 1080p screen. Not a fantastic screen but much better than many other budget notebooks.* Boots significantly faster than older SA version. I\'m not sure why this is the case given how similar hardware is but it is true. Optimized bios?* Decent graphical performance. 1080p h265 movies run great and look very nice. Gaming at native resolution is possible with some older games with middle settings. Games tried include: Company of Heroes, Half-Life 2 Update, Bioshock, and Portal 2. I was averaging about 30 fps with these games at 1920x1080. Gaming performance with newer NA version is better than older SA version.* Excellent keyboard. This one is huge. This notebook has minimal flex in keyboard and is very nice to type on.* Great touchpad and buttons. Much nicer than expected with notebook at this price.* Amazing battery life. This really is an all day notebook. Best battery life of any notebook I have ever owned. Battery time on this new version is better than the older ASUS VivoBook E403SA-US21.* Very nice performance. Solid multitasking performance with no lag or stuttering. The Pentium N4200, 4 GB of RAM, and 128 GB eMMC drive combine to give notebook solid performance.* Excellent Wifi and Bluetooth performance. Having dual band wireless with AC is also a plus. This notebook utilizes an Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 7265 which is another component that is impressive on budget notebook. I get very good range and speeds with the notebook. The AC 7265 is an upgrade over the SA\'s AC 7260. One of the upgrades is bluetooth version 4.2 over the 4.0 in the AC7260.* Type-C port (with charging).* SD slot (though not deep enough for regular SD card). I\'m using the BASEQI Low Profile Micro SD Adapter for Raspberry Pi with a 128gb micro SD card and it works great. This adapter protrudes about 1 mm out of notebook and can be left in at all times with no issues. I put movies and programs on this card to save space on eMMC drive. Programs/games installed on adapter/micro SD card work well (I do have quality fast micro SD card though).Cons:* The new N4200 CPU and Apollo Lake chipset is capable of faster ram speeds (up to 2400 MHz) and using DDR4 memory but they kept DDR3 ram and speed is still at 1600 MHz.* Not the best viewing angles on screen.* .3 megapixel webcam.I\'m not really clear on why the older SA version appears to be selling at a higher price than the newer NA version. Apparently people do not know there is a newer and better version out there :)', b"This is a very basic computer.  It runs extremely slowly once you've got more than 2 Chrome tabs open - I have to keep Outlook and Excel open in the background for work, and as soon as I start opening more tabs it grinds to a halt when opening new pages.  I had to buy a cheap Windows 10 laptop for a short term gig; jury's out if I'll be returning this after the gig ends or keeping it just because it's so darn cheap.I think it would be fine if you never multitasked, like if you used this for streaming videos, or just editing Excel spreadsheets with nothing else open, or showing your grandma some photos. Or, maybe you could upgrade the RAM and Hard Drive with more space - that might speed it up, but if you're spending $150 more on accessorizing just buy a better laptop for $450 to start with!The best features are that it's lightweight and I do like the keyboard layout of Asus.One slightly annoying thing is that even though it has a USB C port - you cannot use it to charge!!!! HUH?!?!! They send a proprietary charger instead. This would be far more annoying if this was my primary device.Otherwise, I strongly prefer my 1st Gen Acer Chromebook which has a much better screen, touchscreen, hinges that can go fully flat, and a zippy processor that keeps hundreds of tabs and apps open all at once. That cost me $500 which was out of budget for this particular gig. BUT I would absolutely buy that one again and skip this laptop, if I didn't HAVE to use Windows.", b"Small, light, simple and well priced laptop. I have a range of computers around the house and just wanted a cheap, light, simple PC to run some windows applications for car maintenance and garage tools. This is perfect, it's cheap, fast enough, the Wi-Fi is good and so far it seems to be a predictable and convenient machine.It's no space rocket, but it does the job efficiently and a very good price point.", b"Great Ubuntu 18.04 notebook!  I have left Windows 10 on for now to play with both Linux and Windows.  I will likely remove it later.  I shrunk the Windows partition and installed Ubuntu 18.04 and rEFInd in a new 32 gb partition.  Powertop shows about 10 hours of expected battery life (after calibration)  with wifi enabled.  It has an SD card slot rather than a microSD slot, and the standard microSD adapters stick out about half way.  I have ordered a low profile adapter made for a RaspberryPi -- hopefully that will let me keep some extra storage around.It does get a little warmer than I expected -- I mention that only because I'm concerned with power consumption and battery life.  I guess time will tell that tale -- I've only had it a couple of days.", b'Great notebook, but need some works. Out of the box I had a lot of freezing and lag issues. I did not want to reinstall the whole Windows in order to achieve a better performance, so I was able to improve by desabling some Windows features and services manualy.The only problem that still bothering me is the low disk space avaiable on the 64Gb version, only about 50% is user accessible.', b"I have only had this a few days. I'm very happy with it. Keyboard is nice, it runs very fast after making a few changes. I cleanup all the old window files and got close to 30g of space. Added a extra mem and I have windows downloading all new files and programs there. For the price of this computer I'm very impressed. I have had more expensive ones that does not preform as well as this one. having wireless AC does make this a wonder.update: i have added office 2016 and runs it great. Hooking up to the internet I'm impress with the speed. This unit runs smooth as a top.I would buy this computer again with no problem. this company makes great computers."]}

It is super soft on the inside and has very durable construction! I like that it has a shoulder strap that is also very comfortable. While this fits the 2012 version perfectly, beware that it is way too big for the newer macbook pro versions! Do not buy this just because it has the shoulder strap if you have the newer macbooks because your computer will be sliding all over the place! I will wait and see if Tomtoc comes out with a smaller version of this bag, because the bag really is awesome.', b'I was looking for a minimal size bag for my 15" MacBook Pro and this bag fits it like a glove! I like the two pockets for extra accessories. I like that the opening for the laptop is from a side.The only thing I would change is make the shoulder strap a bit shorter. Currently it is too long and because of that the slidable buckle prevents the shoulder pad from being in the center.', b"Perfect for my Yoga 920.  I've gone through so many bags and sleeves and none of them fit properly (space inside so it moves around).  This one is PERFECT.  I like the side entry and fits like a glove.  The padded sides touch all edges of my 920.  The front pockets were perfect to put my pens, external DVD player, brick power supply, and multiple cables.  Still has room to spare.The only tiny knock I'll make (but not enough to take out a star) is that the blue is lighter than the picture.  Still looks fine and matches the Star Wars cover of my laptop.I also love that this is a slim case.  Easy enough to use like a slip case but with a handle and strap.Love it!", b'Just got this, so I can\'t vouch for long-term durability, but it looks to be high quality and durable construction with more padding than one usually sees in a sleeve-type case. The shoulder strap is plain webbing which I consider a plus because it will fold up small and tight if needed, and it has a high quality strap pad which will support more weight than you can possibly fit in this bag. The strap pad snugs tightly to the strap, meaning the strap isn\'t going to roll or tangle under the pad and the pad will stay where you put it on the strap. All zippers are installed correctly and work easily. Pockets are well sewn. In all, an impressive bit of design and engineering that is well executed.Two bones to pick, but not taking off any stars. Not what I like, but for other folks this might be exactly what they want.1. From the photo, I thought I\'d have more room in the front pockets than what is there. The pockets don\'t have much depth, and without gussets won\'t expand at all. Both front pockets have internal pockets for a pen and other small items you don\'t want rolling around in the main pocket, but if you put much of anything in the internal pocket, there won\'t be room for that bigger item you want to put in the main pocket. In the left (bigger) pocket I\'ve got a (Lenovo) power adapter attached to an APC PnoteProc8 surge protector (small, 600 Joules, highly recommended), AC cord in the main pocket, and a Yoga mouse (very thin) in the internal pocket.  In the right pocket I\'ve got an SD card reader, thumb drive, USB-C to USB-A adapter, and a pen in the internal pocket plus a business card wallet and phone charging cable in the main pocket. On the one hand, that is a full complement of what I need for travel, but on the other hand, that small complement of items completely fills both pockets. Both are on the edge of bulging with that load, and adding even one more small thing will overstuff the pockets, making them hard to close and causing the contents to possibly dig into your laptop despite the generous padding. That photo showing the pockets overflowing with goodies as if everything they show could fit in there is just B.S.  If you have more than what I describe, look for a different case. And note that the shoulder strap, which on a sleeve-style bag like this will mostly be carried in one of the pockets to be used only when traveling with overly-full hands, cannot fit in either pocket given what else I\'m carrying.  Tomtoc should have further differentiated this case from their non-shoulder-strap version by including pocket gussets on this model. A definite missed trick, even though that also would have increased the price.2. The max internal dimensions they list for the case are a bit misleading.  You can have one dimension at the maximum 12.8" or  the other dimension at the maximum 9.14" but not both. The problem is the really nice (read protective) edge padding, which is rounded at the corners.  My Lenovo Yoga 920 measures 12.68" x 8.81" and it just fits.  (Indeed, if I overstuffed the pockets, I would expect the fabric pulling on the inside faces of the pockets to cause the laptop to fit poorly and make the laptop zipper hard to close.)The padding and pockets make this thing thicker than a typical sleeve, but it still feels like a sleeve.  If you aren\'t carrying more than I describe, this case is the ticket.  At this price ($30 when I purchased), it\'s hard to go wrong.', b'I purchased this case for my new 15" MacBook Pro with touch bar- it fits nearly perfectly and is super snug. The pockets on the front hold the charger and some other stuff with room to spare,  and it seems to be durable and well made.', b'This is a great bag I use it to hold my mbp15\xe2\x80\x9d. In the side pouches I hold the mbp charger my phone and phone charger. The reason for the lower rating is that the stitching for the strap is starting to tear off. I have bought it end of October so it has been a little over a month of use and it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to fall apart.  I do use the bag on a daily basis for work and school. Was hoping for the strap to last longer. I will continue to use the bag as I like it a lot. But would prefer if the stitching was made to last longer than a month.', b"Love it. Looks very nice. Pretty slim (not too bulky). Did not own it for long but quality seems to be good. I can fit in there my 15.6 inch Yoga 720 with the power supply and medium sized mouse in separate compartments and still will have room for portable HDD. and some small accessories. The only thing is that the main pocket for the laptop is not on the top but on the side, so it came in a bit of surprise for me. I'm guessing they made that way so they can fit the handle on top which is very convenient.", b'After researching all possible carry bags for my new 13" 2017 MacBook Pro, I decided on this case because of the reviews and the style of the bag. I particularly liked the outside pockets which seemed perfect for peripherals like my mouse. I definitely made the right choice. My new MacBook Pro fits perfectly, and it\'s completely protected in this high quality case. I couldn\'t be more satisfied with the bag.After it arrived, however, I realized that many reviews stated how it came with a mousepad. This wasn\'t critical to me, but I sent a quick email to Tomtoc asking if a mousepad should\'ve been included. This was just a few days ago, and today in the mail, a mousepad was delivered! It\'s thin and just the right size so that it fits easily into the bag. I\'m delighted with the customer service of this company, and Tomtoc will be the first place I\'ll go in the future if they have the product that I\'m looking for. I highly recommend this bag and this company!']}

I don\'t see any "low memory" messages that are seen in laptops with 32gb or so. This laptop doesn\'t have 802.11ac so 5ghz is not an option. You can buy an adapter for 5ghz if the speed is not fast enough, but for me with Comcast, the speed is good. Opening multiple tabs didn\'t lag which was good. I used a lot of my time to find a good laptop at an affordable price and I have to say this laptop is probably the one. It\'s not that heavy so that\'s good. If you think there\'s better deals out there, I think you\'ll be wasting your time and money on the ones that are too good to be true. Don\'t be too cheap or else you will waste your time returning one laptop after another. Just my 2 cents.', b'I am an older tech user and love this computer. Independent research for "best laptops under $300" showed this Asus on more than one list. So much value for price made lower by applying for Amazon store card at same time. Don\'t care for all the Windows 10 advertising. It felt like a constant commercial at times but have figured out how to disengage a little bit from all the pop ups and "buy me nows".Not a complaint about laptop but with Windows 10.Battery life is more than good. It is attractive design. And some kind man actually left a phone number on his review. I called him and he answered many questions.Very happy with this laptop purchase.', b"Received this January 5 and it's March 18 and it will not power up. It's just dead. Nothing. Two months and it won't do anything. Black screen, nothing. And it cannot be returned. I will never buy a computer through Amazon.", b'Do not purchase. Returned after 2days. Nice looking but very slow', b'I am a long time fan of ASUS computers, I have been for many years. this notebook is very fine. I have only one complaint and that is the power cable sent with it. when you plug cord to notebook it is really loose. So loose that while using the notebook while charging the cord falls out you have to keep a finger holding power cord so you  don\'t have "CHARGING or ON BATTERY\' flashing on the screen. I did contact Amazon support. He said some thing about this was a third party sale. Don\'t know what that. Means. I bought it on Amazon. Any way he was courteous and helpful. He looked in the system found a power cord that shows it will work with mine. He ordered it for me. well he didn\'t check the model number of my note book which is"X541N". Later that day I was looking over the spec\'s for it and no where could I find my model listed so I went on a search looking for a cord that showed my model number. I found one and ordered it. Couple days later the cord that the customer rep ordered arrived. It was too big. So fast forward today(memorial day) and the correct cord is here. That is why a 4 star and not 5 star. This is new notebook have it 1 week.', b'I am an avid customer of Amazon and happy to be able to return this laptop after 24hrs. After my initial log in and loading antivirus software I could not get passed the welcome screen. Tried starting in safe mode as well. Although I bought this laptop for my 9 yr old son I suspected that it would not hold up to the most basic use. I recommend not buying this laptop.', b"This laptop beats any and all other laptop under $400 I ever owned.  I love it.  I'm still hating on Windows 10 but this Asus vivobook has great graphics, can do so much and runs very well.  The cooling system works amazingly well.  It spits out cold air instead of warm or hot which none of my previous laptops have ever done.  It's lightweight if you need to carry it around a lot for school or work.  The Asus brand was recommended by a great friend and I would absolutely both buy Asus again and recommend it to anyone.  It's worth every penny.", b'Really bad product...keeps crashing and screen goes blank several times in a day. I want to return this product or figure out how to get it fixed in India.']}

While traveling, I found this size a little too large, so wanted to move to a 14" variety> The unit is light (approx. 3.7 lbs) and very thin> The keyboard is far better quality than my old Toshiba> The touchpad is only OK. It doesn\'t appear to have advanced motion detection (such as 3-finger swipe to go to previous internet location, etc.)> I use the unit for general work (Word, Excel, surfing, etc) and find the image quality above adequate> The claimed 11 hr battery life is incredible. Haven\'t had to time to get real numbers.> This is my first unit with SSD (comes with 256 GB) and I\'m in love! Very quick to boot, start new programs, etc.) Even my home internet seems to be faster, but that could be just wishful interpretation? You\'ll have to decide for yourself.CONS:> It does NOT have an illuminated keyboard if that is a deal-breaker for you> It does NOT have an Ethernet port! This caught me off-guard.> It does NOT have a Display Port (DP)> It does NOT have a D-Sub connectorHowever, it does has a USB-Type C and there are tons of aftermarket hubs available to provide Ethernet, DP and D-Sub (VGA)CONCLUSION: Bang for the buck here is very high.

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I never understood RT and you can only really use the Edge browser on it. But Edge works well and just customize the start page so your not reading about the royals all day!!! Turned on the Sprint free data and was getting in bit of work at Chipotle today. Apps are on the Microsoft store but I just have office 365 installed so far really. Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

I'm able to conduct my daily business when I need to be mobile. The Mobile MS Office works great, I'm able to do quick photo editing with Photoshop Express with ease and no issues with multi-tasking jumping from program to program or window to window. Of course this is not the same as my elite PC build but this little tablet packs a punch for its size and price, I'm very impressed. Because there's only one USB port I got a Bluetooth mouse so I can still hook up my flash drives and etc. This will also handle the Steam app and Discord, so on my down time I'm able to play games :) . Retro and less demanding games of course, don't expect Call of Duty or Destiny 2 to run on this - use your gaming computer for that.

My Amazon Fire's speakers and iphone8+ are better.-The screen protector tab didn't actually pull off the protector, so it needed to be taken off from another corner.-Instruction manual is a little thin (so knowing when it was fully charged was a guess - and it's when the blue light goes out).-Still evaluating heat, but did get a little warm after playing videos for a while--nothing I worry about, but also will keep an eye on in summer use.I was looking for an inexpensive Windows 10 tablet and this fits the bill. Allows me to do everything I want on the go and fits into my Windows/MS ecosystem. Loving it so far!", b'Excellent value!

It looks good, feels good, runs most games that I\'ve thrown at it at great frame rates. PUBG and Fortnite play very smooth. Skyrim plays with no issues, I haven\'t tried any larger more intensive games but I\'m guessing you can get some pretty good frame rates at medium to high-ish settings. I like the specs a lot, but I do plan on upgrading the ram to 16Gb and the 1Tb HDD to a faster SDD. The screen looks really nice, gets fairly bright and good viewing angles. The speakers sound pretty good, a bit better than average. The only downsides I\'ve noticed is battery life and noise. When your playing any games its "CoolBoost" technology kicks in and its quite loud. BUT it does keep this laptop really cool on a desk. It could be a different story when its sitting on a bed. The battery life does really suck since its a gaming computer but it doesn\'t really bother me. One problem is the strength of the lower screen. When you push inward or outward on the bottom middle of the trim around the screen it flexes really bad. So much so that I fear I could accidentally break it when carrying this thing around the house with it open.Other than that I highly recommend this to someone who cant spend the extra 400 for a gaming laptop. At 750, this is a pretty good deal.Fix the screen flex problem though Acer, haha.', b"I bought this computer last month as a replacement for my Dell, and so far it's been great. It runs my games perfectly, and the speed is incredible. My only complaints involve the fan. When I run most of my games on it (primarily WoW, D3,), the fan gets really loud and the computer gets very hot. I'm a little concerned about it overheating, but after a few minutes it starts to cool down. Otherwise, a great computer for a great price.", b"super fast and very economical!I 'm not a gamer but were looking for something fast ...I am blessed", b"This thing is so slow, even with no extraneous programs installed on it. I spent several hours trying to clean it up and using other tricks involving disabling various windows features to try to fix it, and it's still slow. As I'm sitting here typing this on my main computer, it's shooting up to 100% disk usage while I'm not running anything except task manager.It looks really cool; the graphics card is pretty nice, but we can't play anything because it has heavy stutter and programs take too long to load.Also, the laptop box wasn't sealed, so that has me concerned that someone had already returned this before.I wanted to like this, but I am profoundly disappointed by it.", b"This laptop works great, the only issue I have is the the screen is pretty flexible other than that it works great. Also a heads up on future buyers it will not read the Nvidia out of the box you must configure it to load off of it or it will use the intigrated Intel graphics (and we all know what that's like) but once it's configured it can run just pretty much anything fluctuating between 45-60fps but because it is a 1050 I recommend getting a laptop docking fan because it will get hot over long term use. Otherwise great product Acer"]}

HP left the space for a CD drive open, so there is plenty of space to add as large a capacity SSD as you wish. I bought this adapter case, removed the circuit board with the two SSD connectors on it and discarded the mechanical pieces in the recycle bin (trash). Then I used some Velcro tape to secure the new SSD to the inside of the case where the non-existent disk drive area was reserved. Some parts you will need:  The roll on sticky tape is to apply to the two rubber standoffs that are on either side of the battery on the backside. You have to remove these two rubber feet to gain access to the two pairs of screws underneath.  When you need to reapply these rubber feet later, you\'ll need some good roll-on glue to make them stick better.  And these rolls of double sided tape are very useful for applying address labels and other such projects, so it isn\'t an entire waste. It lays down a solid strip of adhesive compared to another product that only lays down dots of adhesive.HIGHROCK Hard Drive Caddy Tray 9.5mm Universal SATA 2nd HDD HD SSD Enclosure Hard Drive Caddy Case Tray, for 9.5mm Laptop CD / DVD-ROM Optical Bay Drive Slot (for SSD and HDD)VELCRO Brand - Sticky Back - 3 1/2" x 3/4" Strips, 4 Sets - BlackDuck Brand Easy-Stick Double Stick Adhesive Roller, 0.31-Inch x 255.6-Inches, 4-Pack of Rollers (280307) As a result, the disk speed increased from 6.75 to 8.1 - a rather significant improvement, but most of all, plenty of space for lots of apps and data storage.  All the other parameters stayed the same, of course. Then I formatted the 29 GB disk to be just a storage area since the Operating System is now on the 240 GB SSD I added. It is quite difficult to open up the case to access the inside of the laptop computer. But my wife did it in about 15 minutes. I made a mistake of not cloning the new drive first like I usually do.  I thought I could back up the recovery disk onto a USB drive.  And I did, but it was not successful. It could have been successful in hindsight if I had the benefit of my current experience. I had to purchase a CD caddy to get a circuit board adapter, but it was less than $10. I took photos of the inside of the laptop computer that I will attach eventually.  If you choose to do this, you really need to have some experience upgrading computers. It is not a simple task.  I will put a video link in a comment.-------------------------------This is an amazing deal for an entry level $200 laptop computer. I realize some people may be concerned with the small 32 GB eMMC SSD, and you will be correct in the long term. The disk will eventually fill up. The operating system takes up about 16.1 GB of the SSD\'s 32 GB storage space, which is about half. However, if you are willing to give up the hibernate mode, you can save about 1.4 GB just by disabling the hibernate file. It just takes a few minutes and it is very simple. You can search on Google to learn how to do it. You can store a huge amount of photos with 1.4 GB \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s free. Also, if you are still a fan of the Windows 7 look and feel, purchase Start 10 for $5 and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so glad you did. It is the very first thing I do with a new computer.First and foremost, here are the Windows Experience Index scores. And yes, there really is a Windows Experience Index included in Windows 10. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t straightforward how to do it. These are real and indisputable performance numbers. There is no artificial limit of 7.9 in Windows 10.CPU Score \xe2\x80\x93 6.7  (Currently 8.1 with new 240 GB SSD Drive)Memory Score \xe2\x80\x93 5.9SSD Score \xe2\x80\x93 6.75Video Encoding Score \xe2\x80\x93 6.6Video Graphics Score \xe2\x80\x93 4.8Bottom Line: Astonishingly Good Performance for $200And if you are tempted to increase the RAM in this computer just because you can, I suggest that you don\xe2\x80\x99t.  There is a page file that has to be created in your precious SSD that is equal to the size of your RAM. So if do add 4 GB of RAM, there goes another 4 GB of your SSD space.  Want to see where all your space goes?  Download Spacesniffer (free) and watch it portrayed visually. And by the way, 4 GB of RAM is plenty. You\xe2\x80\x99ll probably use less than half of that RAM in normal operation. Right now I\xe2\x80\x99m watching a streaming HD video on Netflix and the CPU usage is only 22% and the RAM usage is 65% of the 4 GB of RAM. At idle, the CPU usage is 2% and the RAM usage is 43%.  So save money and your precious hard disk space and don\xe2\x80\x99t buy any additional RAM.The eMMC style solid state disk (SSD) is considerably faster than a mechanical hard drive and somewhat slower than a more conventional SSD.  You probably already have a spare SDHC memory card that you can use as additional memory to make up for the relatively small 32 GB eMMC SSD memory.  I plan to use a high speed SD card as a location to store all my photos and videos. That\'s what takes up most of my storage space.  My documents and other things are much smaller files.  This is the fastest SD card I could find. I don\'t know if I will purchase the 64 GB or 128 GB SD card yet. For now I am using a 32 GB SD card that seems to be very fast.Lexar Professional 1000x 64GB SDXC UHS-II/U3 Card (Up to 150MB/s read) w/Image Rescue 5 Software LSD64GCRBNA1000According to my tape ruler, this display is a full 14 inches of diagonal viewable area \xe2\x80\x93 which is the standard method of measurement. Battery life is surprisingly good. I haven\'t done a timed test yet, but it is as good as my far more expensive 17 inch HP laptop computer. Of course the battery is bigger for the 17 inch laptop computer.  I chose a solid black background just in case it contributes to power consumption. Most likely the backlight is always on, so it may not matter. It depends upon how the engineers designed the computer.The speed isn\'t going to set any world records, but it is plenty fast as long as you are not planning to use it as a high performance gaming computer. I watched a Netflix movie and there was not even the slightest issue that I could see. I have 50 Mb/second internet service, so download speed was not a factor. That\xe2\x80\x99s a completely separate matter. This computer booted from a cold power on start to being on the internet in 35 seconds displaying a fully loaded web page.  There are not many SSD based desktop computers that can do that. I did delete some useless start up files.  I am a career electrical engineer and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been building computers since 1982, so I know how to improve and maintain performance.  Actually, there weren\xe2\x80\x99t many junk applications on the computer when I got it, which was pleasantly surprising.  I got rid of the MacAfee software and downloaded Microsoft Security Essentials to be my antivirus software and it\xe2\x80\x99s free.The keyboard key spacing is very slightly less than my wireless HP keyboard.  I type without looking at my keyboard, so even that slight amount was noticeable to me.  The keyboard layout takes some adjustment to find where the seldom used keys are located. The keys require more effort to press than my wireless HP keyboard, but not much more. I read someone\xe2\x80\x99s comment they could see under the keys, but is certainly not the case with mine. It appears well designed and robust.So I give this low cost entry level laptop computer a full 5 stars based on performance and price. This would make a good college laptop computer that\xe2\x80\x99s small and relatively lightweight. The touch pad works fine if you are used to it. I always use a mouse, but I will use the touch pad if needed. It has the fastest wireless internet speed 802.11ac and even Bluetooth. So you can even purchase a Bluetooth mouse and not use up a USB port. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had superb results with all my HP products. It is a great company and I endorse their products.-----------------Disclaimer:I did receive this on the Amazon Vine program, but I write my reviews the same as if I purchased it. Furthermore, it is not free.  I have to pay self employment social security of 15.1% and in addition, I have to pay income tax on the Vine items bringing it up to about 33% overall taxation.  Amazon reports all Vine products as income to the IRS.  In addition, I normally must have actually purchased a similar item with my own money just like you and wrote a review on that item in the past. There is no guarantee I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever get similar products on Vine in the future. I\xe2\x80\x99ve written over 850 reviews and the overwhelming number of those reviews were for things I bought with my own money \xe2\x80\x93 and wrote a review on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work.I would never knowingly mislead anyone to purchase something I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t purchase myself.  I do have a conscience and some integrity. I get zero preferential treatment for writing fluffed up reviews, so reason to do it.  Look at my reviews and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see some one star Vine reviews and everything in between.  It is what it is. I am an electrical engineer and I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing, but I can make mistakes. If I do, please write it in a comment and please don\xe2\x80\x99t just ding me for no reason. I\xe2\x80\x99d appreciate it. Well, apparently 13 people did ding me for no reason anyway. There\'s nothing wrong with this review.  I worked my guts out on it and I even have a broken neck - 5 of my 8 vertebras are bolted together with ten screws to a metal plate.  It hurts more than you can imagine to write even a short review.  And this is my thanks.', b'Our sons, ages 13 and 12, are headed into eighth and seventh grades. They needed a computer for some basic processing and the ability to browse the web for research. We wanted to keep them in a Windows 10 environment that marries with my wife\xe2\x80\x99s Toshiba LX835-D3310 All-in-One Desktop and my Toshiba Satellite laptop. Unfortunately, Toshiba\xe2\x80\x99s Tecra line of laptops start at twice the price of the\xc2\xa0HP 14-Inch Notebook.COMPARISONToshiba Tecra C40-C1400ED ($399) \xe2\x80\xa2 Intel\xc2\xae Celeron\xc2\xae Processor 3855U \xe2\x80\xa2 Windows 10 Pro (National Academic License) \xe2\x80\xa2 14.0" diagonal widescreen \xe2\x80\xa2 4 GB DDR3L 1600 MHz \xe2\x80\xa2 128 GB M.2 Solid State Drive (SSD) \xe2\x80\xa2 DTS Studio Sound\xe2\x84\xa2, Stereo Speakers \xe2\x80\xa2 3.97 lbsHP Notebook 14-an013nr ($199) \xe2\x80\xa2 AMD Quad-Core E2-7110 APU (1.8 GHz, 2MB cache) \xe2\x80\xa2 Windows 10 Home \xe2\x80\xa2 14.0-inch diagonal Full HD IPS UWVA BrightView WLED-backlit (1920 x 1080) \xe2\x80\xa2 4 GB LPDDR3 SDRAM (onboard) \xe2\x80\xa2 32GB eMMC (flash storage) \xe2\x80\xa2 AMD Radeon R2 Graphics \xe2\x80\xa2 DTS Studio Sound\xe2\x84\xa2, Stereo Speakers \xe2\x80\xa2 3.86 pounds.PROS \xe2\x80\xa2 HD screen \xe2\x80\x94 While it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the main intention for the HP Notebook, my sons are happy about its BrightView WLED-backlit HD screen, which they can use to stream movies or chat with friends via Skype. \xe2\x80\xa2 Portability \xe2\x80\x94 At 0.94 by 13.6 by 9.5 inches (HWD) and 3.9 pounds, the HP is portable both around the house (from one bedroom to another) and in their school backpacks. \xe2\x80\xa2 Design \xe2\x80\x94 Personally, the smaller keyboard wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work for me as I use a\xc2\xa0Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000\xc2\xa0for all of my processing. For my sons (again, ages 13 and 12), the smaller keyboard isn\xe2\x80\x99t an issue. While the touchpad is responsive, my sons asked for a wireless mouse, so I paired a\xc2\xa0Kensington Pro Fit Mid-Size Wireless Mouse. \xe2\x80\xa2 Performance \xe2\x80\x94 Keeping in mind the price tag is less than $200, the 1.8GHz quad-core AMD E2-7110 QC processor and 4GB of memory and a 32GB eMMC storage delivers the basics, nothing more. \xe2\x80\xa2 Expandable \xe2\x80\x94 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the key word. Thankfully, the HP comes with an SD card slot. Whether we eventually expand storage via the SD card slot or use and external HDD is a question for later this year. We already subscribe to Amazon Drive for unlimited, secure cloud storage of our photos, files, videos, music, and more. Amazon Drive is as essential to our family as our Amazon Prime membership.In summary, for an inexpensive laptop PC with an Windows 10 environment, the\xc2\xa0HP 14-Inch Notebook\xc2\xa0is a solid value and perfect for my middle-school-aged sons. This Notebook will be used for processing, surfing the Internet, chatting with friends via Skype and watching streaming videos from our Amazon Prime account. The Notebook isn\xe2\x80\x99t built for \xe2\x80\x94 and won\xe2\x80\x99t be used for \xe2\x80\x94 gaming. If your needs are similar to ours, I highly recommend this HP Notebook.Rating: Five stars', b'I was looking for a lightweight laptop I could use professionally.  And after the endless nightmare I had with my Dell laptop, I was more than happy to give this laptop a try.  I found it very easy to set up, creating the necessary logins, and was surprised, every time I picked it up, by how very light it is!  I did some quick and easy searches, downloaded Evernote and Dropbox, and have had no probably with some of the issues I have seen in other reviews. The laptop is just as fast as I would expect it to be, given the hardware.Best of all, it can be upgraded.  Since my son actually builds computers, I shall have no problem customizing this small but perfect for my needs laptop.', b"Ok, I'm just going to come out and say it: This is NO speed demon. But for the price, it's actually a really decent laptop.I had no trouble with initial setup and was up and running within 30 minutes. After updates, there was about 14gb available. The laptop was responsive and actually kind of fun to use. It has an above average keyboard and the screen...the screen is GORGEOUS! I was also impressed with the connectivity options and the inclusion of an Ethernet jack.Again, it's not the fastest thing in the world, but it's not meant to be. For everyday use (web browsing, documents, LIGHT photo editing, etc) you're not going to find much better for the price."]}

I honestly didn\'t think it would be as good as it is, but it\'s even better. I love the soft inner fabric. I love that it zips all the way around the corners. And I love...LOVE...the extendable handle! It lays flat when not in use, which is perfect for when I shove it in my school bag.The zipper portion was surprising as well. I thought for sure it wouldn\'t handle my laptop charging cable, phone charging cable, and mouse; but this thing fit all of them with room to spare and still zipped perfectly. It did bulge quite a bit though, but that\'s to be expected I suppose.To be honest I was disappointed in the color. The grey is beautiful, but I was expecting a tan color on the edge. Instead it\'s a deep orange. Not a fault in the product, just lack of description. I can live with it, I just think it looses a bit of the professional look. Maybe I should have gone for the teal.I purchased the 14-15.6 inch and it fits my 15" laptop perfectly (HP Envy TS m6 Sleekbook). I even had an "oops" moment when I dropped my laptop (first time I\'ve ever dropped it - that\'s what I get for trying to carry groceries at the same time). Granted, it hit carpeted floor, but the case protected my laptop beautifully. Not a scratch on it, and it still performs perfectly (I\'m writing this review from it now). This case wouldn\'t prevent a car running over it or something; and if you dropped it on concrete the impact may damage the inside of a laptop, but it definitely wouldn\'t have a scratch on it! LOLIf you\'re interested in this case, I highly suggest watching TorridlyBoredShopper\'s video. It\'s what convinced me to purchase this case and I\'m glad I did. This thing is great. I may even buy another in a different color just to change things up every once in a while.', b'The smaller dimensions of the brand new 15" MacBook Pro mean it will fit in some 13-inch laptop bags. I looked at the dimensions and ordered this, and sure enough it fits perfectly.It has a very nice soft padding on the inside and some foam protection. The outside pocket easily fits a power adapter, hard drive, and plenty of dongles. But best of all, this is just a nice simple, thin case to keep your laptop without all the extra bulk and a simple carry handle.', b'Absolutely tremendous.  Great feel, sturdy handle, gorgeous zippers that close tight and smooth.What they don\xe2\x80\x99t show you is the zipper on the side pocket, which makes it a good spot for anything that likes to fall out of bags.The inside microfiber is awesome, and eye-catching, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t unzip fully you can open both the laptop and the cover and they will hold together.IF you like a tight fit, the 12-12.9 fits the MBP better.  This one has enough extra room to fold when the computer is in.', b"I wanted to make a video about how well this works, and I left my larger tablet at work. That meant making it for interior and exterior materials and showcasing the sizing on something smaller, but hopefully this helps highlight what I am saying on sizing and design aspects anyhow.When looking at this, some of the great things about it are:-It's simple and yet efficient.- Nice materials.- Quality stitching.- Good aesthetic incorporation of concealed zippers/handle.- Nice interior inlay.- Excellent padding.- Plenty of room.- Loads of storage in exterior pocket.Please note that this was supplied for sampling purposes and hopefully the review addition showcases what it looks like outside of the product page.", b'My 15" MacBook Pro fits well in this case, without forcing and without too much extra room. It seems like a well made case and I like the materials better than those neoprene cases with the small access opening.I really like the extra zippered pocket on this case. It fits my charger, external hard drive and a CF card adapter, without forcing and without adding too much bulk.The 2 zippers on this case open all the way around to the handle, making access to my laptop super easy. But, that feature is sort of the only thing I\'d change on this bag, if I could lol. The handle is on the opposite side of the full zipper opening and the first day I had the case, I didn\'t realize I had the zipper opened on the other side, picked up the case by the handle, which resulted in my laptop falling out the other side, onto the floor. It\'s not a deal breaker and was my own stupidity, but it\'s definitely something I need to think about, each time I take my laptop in and out of it.I also got a Kuzy laptop cover, in hot blue and it matches the teal color on this case pretty well.Bottom line, this is a great laptop case and I DID NOT receive any discounts for this review.', b'As others have reviewed the quality of the ProCase 12 is fantastic. I purchased this for my new iPad Pro with 12.9" screen and Smart Keyboard. I was worried the iPad with keyboard attached and charger + cord in the side pocket would prove to be too tight a fit for the ProCase. My worries were unfounded!

Good protection. When I got the laptop for the first time, the screen was defective and Amazon customer service did a fantastic job in not only making sure they arranged for the quick return of the laptop but also ensured replacement was sent in time.Thank you for understanding my plea and for your prompt action.Laptop looks great & it is extremely light (very surprised by this)Processor:-It comes with the i7 7700hq processor. It is fast and provides smooth operation.Backlit keyboard - red color.Keyboard:-The keyboard layout is excellent, well spaced out keys for fast typing.There is a separate number keypad like what you find on normal keyboards for desktop pcs.There are many shortcut keys. Keys feel great while typing.Experienced typists will have a great time typing on this keyboard.The touchpad is very responsive and works very well. You can pinch to zoom or scroll up and down using two fingers.Windows:-It came with Windows 10 home edition. I should have spoken with customer service to get windows 10 pro, don't like home edition at all.Being an IT guy I prefer Windows 10 pro over home edition any day.Battery:-Laptop doesn't get heated up at all. You won't think about it even once. The adapter doesn't get heated up either even after using for long hours. So people who want to use this laptop for long hours, you will love this. I always have the power adapter connected. Battery lasts for 4 hrs - browsing, office work(There is MSI battery software that calibrates the battery, very useful).It was saying 94% plugged in, not charging.I used MSI battery calibration app & overnight it calibrated very well.Now it is showing 100% fully charged. Warning* Do not unplug the charger or use the laptop while this is going on.You will see get this warning even in that app.If you still see this message then drain the battery completelyScreen:-I think the screen is a matte finish. No reflections on the screen & great viewing angles.The 1080p screen is really noticeable. Watching videos or playing games has been a great experience on this laptop. The screen is crystal clear & absolutely gorgeous.Boot time:-Performance - outstanding!!! I am very impressed with fast boot times. 10 seconds to boot up into Windows OS.The laptop is fast and there is no lag whatsoever. Compressing & extracting zip files extremely quickly.Connectivity:-WIFI is excellent, has many options in the settings.Bluetooth connectivity is great. The laptop connects to my Bluetooth speaker pretty quickly and stays connected even after the reboot.4 USB ports. 1 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3.0 and 1 USB 3.1 port along with USB type-c port.Fast data transfer- > It was transferring at 100MB/s speed. Tested it multiple times.128 GB SSD is outstanding, if you have an option go for 256 GB SSD it is really worth the money.There is also 1 TB hard disk for storage. So you have enough space.Wireless Display:-There is Wireless Display option which works really great. This is a huge deal for me because I want to connect to the projector using RKCast and I am extremely happy that it works very well. No lag at all. I played Mortal Kombat XL and didn't notice any lag even with highest settings. Nvidia 1050 totally worth it. But if you are undecided then go for Nvidia GTX 1060 as it supports VR.RAM:-This laptop comes with 8 GB RAM DDR4. The main reason I chose this one because it has the option to upgrade to 32GB in future.Since I didn't have enough money I could afford only 8 GB but if money is not an issue then pick 32 GB. It is totally worth it. Absolutely brilliant performance.Fan noise is very minimal so that is not a problem either because I read many reviews for other laptops (MSI or others) where people complained about laptop fan noise. But that is not a problem at all for this laptop. It is pretty silent and pleasant to use.Camera:-The camera is really good. Press Fn + F6 if you face an issue with camera app on windows.  You can take burst shot ( continuous photos) like you can in android phones.Speakers:-Speakers are good, very clear sound, but not comparable to JBL speakers that I used before in my old Dell XPS laptop. They are louder and have good bass. Having said that, I still like the speakers on this laptop. They are not exactly an issue. It will take some time for me to get used to them. But the new buyers can always get great Bluetooth powered speakers for less than 50$ on Amazon.Overall:-I am not deducting any stars for that because the positives in this laptop overshadow everything else.Experience in using this laptop has been outstanding!!!!I totally recommend this laptop to everyone who is looking for a good laptop at a decent price. It is totally worth it whether it is typing documents or running virtual machines or watching videos or playing graphics-intensive games or duplicating the screen to the projector. It does everything flawlessly.I am very impressed. So far I am extremely happy and I hope I don't face any issues or have unpleasant surprises in future.Thank you for reading my review.Update Dec 29th, 2017:-Upgraded my laptop to 32GB after 1 month of purchase. Spent 265$ for 32GB RAM from Crucial 2400 MTS from Newegg website.But my observation is laptop won't use more than 16GB of RAM. So you can decide as per your requirements.When I opened 3 or 4 VMs and running them parallelly, it used at the most 12 or 13GB of RAM but the CPU usage was very high.My setting was 90% for Max CPU usage & Min is at 5% for balanced mode & for high performance - I kept the minimum at 50%. You can set this in Power settings.So my laptop's performance is still outstanding even after 5 months of purchase. It kept getting better & faster every day.Update - June 9th 2018Laptop's performance just kept getting better.Do not install Nvidia driver from the website. Let Windows install the drivers. This way you won't lose the option to connect wirelessly to your projector or TV.Performed best with Windows 1709 update. But after 1803 volume became comparatively lower.I am using Equalizer APO to boost the volume but it is still less for my liking.Windows 1803 has also messed up BluetoothThese issues are more related to Windows 10 pro 1803 update than laptop itself.So watch out for these two problems.Having said that. Windows 1803 improved gaming performance.I can also watch Netflix wirelessly using Intel WiDi on my laptop connected to projector with HDMI dongle.Cheers!Sam", b'I really like this MSI laptop, its a very good product at a good price.The good:*The specs are awesome [i7-7700HQ|1050 2G|8GB|128GB+1TB] for the price its a bargain.*The OS is installed on the 128GB SSD, it makes everything to run faster, the laptop has a very good performance.*The red backlit keyboard is great. I would like to have more color options, though.*The 1tb HDD was imperative to me.*The image of the screen is beautiful and colorful. I like the anti-glare screens because the areas where i usually work on the day are always so illuminated with many windows.The bad:*The plastic of witch it is made is thin and somewhat fragile.*The sound of the speakers is bad... They lack of bass... i think.*I dont like the touchpad of this laptop, i just dont get used to it... I liked the alienware 13 touchpad more...I recommend this laptop, its a great option for work and play videogames.', b'Great BUSINESS laptop.  The keyboard is far sturdier than the flimsy one in most laptops and the backlighting is not only cool looking but useful.  One of the best laptop keyboards ever.  Very fast responsive laptop (I use it for business, not gaming) with great storage, great speed and sturdy build.  FAR better for the price than comparable laptops from Dell, HP, Toshiba, Acer, ASUS, etc (have used the others).decent battery life - about 4 hours before I get low with heavy use.', b"Had the laptop for around a month now. The most pleasing aspect of the laptop is the build. The laptop feels solid enough but at the same is not too bulky. I can carry it around for a day without hurting my back. The performance is great. Thanks to the ssd the laptop boots under 8s and other functions are smooth as well. Having an additional HDD certainly helps for gamers though it gives a feel that it takes forever to load games or softwares. The wireless connectivity options are working properly and provide great speeds on wifi. The most frustrating thing is the battery backup. Even with power saving mode on the laptop lasts hardly over an hour and a half. Plus the power saving mode gives the feel of working on a 4-year old netbook! Other than that the laptop has been a great revelation and as a fairly active gamer I'm quite happy with it."]}

The touchscreen works. The DVD burner works. I haven't had the chance to play many games on it, yet, but it's able to handle Sister Location, at least. (My old laptop, R.I.P, wasn't even able to play those games without almost overheating.) It's quick, and I'm able to have programs such as Microsoft Office and Photoshop, along with others, open at the same time without it causing any problems. As of now, I'm 100% satisfied with it, and I'd recommend this to anyone who's in need of a nice, but cheap laptop.", b"This is such a fantastic laptop! I took my time to find a perfect product and this laptop met all my expectations. I was a bit concerned, because some people mentioned that it's slow. My advice is to ignore these comments. Unless you want to use it for the most advanced games, I can guarantee that you will not have such issues. It's fast and reliable. It doesn't freeze and I didn't have any problems with Windows updates. It's quiet and pretty light, but definitely does not feel cheap.The keyboard is soft and nice. I tend to work on several apps at the same time and watch movies online, and the streaming is perfect. The battery life is impressive. I like plugging it into TV with the HDMI cable (not included) and can watch a couple movies while it's unplugged.The condition is perfect and I would never guess that it's beem refurbished. It comes with Windows, so you don't have to pay for it separately.You can also get a trial version of MS Office for free, but you'd need to pay for subscription after the first month.I highly recommend it!", b'This is the first time I ever purchased a "refurbished" computer.  I did purchase an additional 2 year warranty.  Since I just use it for personal roaming the internet and doing family income taxes I didn\'t want to spend a great deal of money on a new computer.Everyone who sees it and tries it out assures me that I got a good "deal" on it.I\'m pleased with it and have no "buyers remorse".  Works for me.', b'Very nice laptop. Very satisfied with purchase. Does all I need for a lap top. Touch screen is really nice.', b'Very satisfied with this laptop. I especially like the touch screen. I was especially concerned after reading some of the other reviews about it not actually being a touch screen. That is the first thing I checked when I got it up and running. This thing is fast with lots of memory and storage. I am actually going to buy another one for my wife because she is always using mine.', b'This is basically good and I like it. One thing I like to say is that the wifi at home is sometimes disconnected often.Whenever it happens, I disconnect and connect from wifi setting on right bottom then it is solved everyday.', b'False advertising!! No touch screen or CD/DVD player/burner.', b'I am writing this review while using the computer I am reviewing.  After much time has past, I am still loving this computer.  It looks nice, works well, and the speed is fine for what I use it for....web surfing, youtube/netflix watching, etc.  I do no gaming or heavy work related things, just basic stuff and it is great.']}

I uninstalled Norton and everything by Acer.  Windows updates takes a very long time as there are major updates which have been released since these units were imaged.After the cleanup and updates, I am happy with these (I have deployed 4 of them so far).Update 1/3/2018:  I have purchased more of these units.  I downloaded the current Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft and did a clean install, improves performance, even more, when there truly is no garbage pre-installed.  Far fewer windows updates have to be installed by using a recent ISO too.', b"I purchased this laptop because my Acer Chromebook is making grad school impossible so I needed a new 'real' computer with an operating system. I don't really use it for more than school work, internet surfing and the occasional office work via Log Me In.  It does the job and I love it so far. I wouldn't be able to rate this based on gaming or anything super techy but for the basic user it does what it's supposed to.", b'It was really slow at first but is much better now that I got rid of the Norton and a few other programs that were slowing it down. Mouse is very sensitive and still trying to get use to that. All in all is a nice little laptop. light and thin, easy to carry around. :)', b"This computer was/ is a good investment.Who is this for? (Who am I?)1. The computer was for my wife, and she only likes to do simple things like check her email and talk with her mother in China. This computer serves that purpose.2. This computer was for a husband that was not willing to spend a lot of money to buy a state of the art computer for someone to use it for only basic life things. This computer serves that purpose and works at that price point.3. This computer was for someone who likes to watch movies every now and then on a good sized screen. This computer serves that purpose.We've had it for a week and there are no evident problems.Verdict: Strongly recommended.", b"I ordered this for a customer, great Lappy for the price, if your gonna use this for web browsing, FB, Twitter, Instagram, FB games or light gaming it's perfect for that, Steam Games  Maybe depends on the Game?Remember no Optical Drive because this is to thin for a drive to fit, plus CD's, DVD's are going away so now there's need for a drive u can putl Win on a flash drive to install it on a PC.So as far as this lappy it's good seemed fast as I was setting it up, I upgraded it to the April 2018 update all is good it runs great with no issues at all.I can sell $300 to $400 Lappy's all day long People won't pay over that.", b'Very underwhelming. Very slow computer, takes longer than an eight year old MacBook Air which has a processor that should be 50% as fast and should have worse video capabilities. Struggles to load up emails... yes its slow to load up emails ( I would have gone with a Chromebook if I had know this).The specs and what not for this laptop all seem very good for the price, but the performance does not live up to those specs at all. Not sure how "High Performance" is allowed in this items name, I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase and wish I had returned it during the retune period.', b"For the price, I'm pleased with the overall performance. I haven't had a problem with speed. My issue is that at least once per day it says the PC has encountered an error and has to restart. Pretty annoying. If you can tolerate that, it's a great buy - just make sure you save your work a lot!", b'So far this laptop has worked great for me and what I need it for. I use mainly for my college homework.']}

I had an HP Pavilion g7 before, so the size was about the same, so I could use my old laptop case. THis is a hundred times better. The processing and everything is pretty awesome. Admittedly, I don't care much for the speakers, but then I don't watch much on my laptop, and stream it to my Xbox anyway. So that's negligible, unlessI took a half a star off this because, as despite what this listing says, all HP Envy 17t models come with a touch screen. I did some research after discovering that. Now, it might just be that I'm used to having separate buttons on my trackpad, but I found the track pad on this is mediocre at best. It's ultra sensitive, so just the slightest bump of it while scrolling on word or chrome will immediately send it into zoom mode. Additionally, not all of the games I play register the scrolling motion. So I would definitely recommend purchasing a mouse along side. I purchased a Logitech M570 Wireless Trackball mouse, but I'm on my computer a lot for school and work.The only other downside that it negligible is the brushed metal panel on the bottom around the keyboard and trackpad is a skin oil magnet. Otherwise, love it. Haven't had any major problems. Definitely worth the price for what's inside.", b'I got this model because I like 17" screens and wanted a powerful machine with Windows 10 and an SSD. Overall, I like it. Pros: The screen is excellent and HD movies look great. With Windows 10 and a 256 GB SSD for windows and programs, it boots and runs very very fast. Plenty of room for data on the 1 TB hard drive. The Mac-like keyboard is big, with a separate number pad. 4 USB ports, and HDMI port. A big plus -the speaker system is fantastic, the best I ever heard in a laptop - loud enough to fill a hotel room at about half volume, with surprisingly good bass.Cons: It is heavy! Not only the machine itself but also the transformer brick. Battery life is not great, but it does charge pretty fast. I would not recommend this machine if you will be carrying it around daily or plan to use it on planes in coach class (where the size would be awkwardly big). But I use it mainly in the hotel on business trips, and for me, the big screen is a good trade-off for the weight and size.  There may be an issue with the trackpad, which sometimes seems to fail to register left clicks. I see that others have had defective trackpads. For me it is not a big enough issue to send the machine back, but I would recommend checking yours carefully if you buy one.What I looked for before buying this was the lightest possible Windows 10 machine with a 17" screen and a  single 500 GB SSD....without extra hard drive and without DVD drive, which I don\'t really need. I came up empty in that search. But although this machine is a lot heavier than I would like, especially with the transformer, overall I really like it, and the great speaker system is a good partial trade-off for the weight.', b"I've had the computer for about a month.PRO: Very fast, quick boot time, Crisp screen. Good keyboard touch and backlighting. Quiet operation. Runs cool.CON:  Speakers are terrible, expect to use earphones or ext speaker if sound needed.I bought it to run Linux Mint.  Using GRUB to dual boot. Wireless card and Canon printer not recognized out of the box. Had to turn off the touch pad and use a mouse because cursor focus would jump all over.Overall I like the computer.", b"Love love love this laptop!!! Extremely fast, wonderful keyboard, TouchPad is great. I have NOT complaints about this product, only great things to say! From the time it's completely shut down, to the time it's fully up and running takes mere seconds!! It is amazing!", b'Faster than a speeding bullet. Is as advertised; with the exception of it being a touch screen; which I believe is part of the description. Not disappointed. Any computer literate individual knows to buy a touch screen laptop under 500 dollars would require divine intervention.', b'Love this laptop. I wouldn\'t recommend it to someone who plans to travel a lot, because this machine is large and not light. But if you plan to use it mainly as a "desktop" computer, this is the perfect choice. Fast, great sound, and plenty of memory space.', b'Ssd, fingerprint security and feel of keyboard really make this unit a pleasure to work with.  Battery life just not there. Windows 10 love it or hate it. Performance, I have used better.  Screen is very good.  Weight wish was lighter.  Recommend yes got what I paid for yes.performance', b'Working great so far, but the drive is very slow due to windows updates, sync of OneDrive, and DropBox  I am hoping after the 200gig is completed today it should get back to normal.']}

Just a couple issues which bring my rating to three points. The allen wrench was misshapen, and didn\'t fit the screws, but fortunately, I had another in the same size that did the trick. There was a stray piece of material not easily visible stuck on the inside of the tube that prevented the screw from going in, but again removing it corrected the problem. My most critical complaint, and one that will probably cause me to return it, is that the depth measurements are incorrect as shown in the detail images. The image of the riser shows 11" on the depth of the leg beginning on the inside of the curve (which is even with the back of platform) to the front of the leg. Since I absolutely needed 11" of depth on the platform, I purchased the stand. Unfortunately, the platform itself only measures  9-1/8" deep.', b"This makes my neck feel so much better when I have to be seated at my computer for a long time. It fits perfectly for my laptop, the ventilation holes work really well, and the stand is sturdy, so I don't have to worry about my laptop slipping off of it or the stand slipping off my desk. It raises my computer just a little over four inches from the desk surface, so it will take me some getting used to as far as the angle of my wrists when typing, but actually, it forces your wrists into a more ergonomically sound position anyway, so it's probably better for me in the long run.Plus, super easy to put together. It came with instructions, but you really don't need them. The two u-shaped legs come with bolts that just screw right into the base.The only thing I would suggest would be on the packaging end - it was in its regular box (like you would see in a store), but that was not boxed for USPS. Our mail delivery person left it sitting on the front porch, and it's snowing, so the box got wet. We noticed it fairly quickly, but if we hadn't happened to look out on the front porch when we did, the box would have been soaked through.", b'Exactly what I need to cover the cable box and place the TV on top.. It barely fit but so far so good. Nice space between the cable box and stand. With the holes in the top of the stand I do not worry about the box overheating. I read two reviews about how this adjusts. I could not find a way to adjust any part of this  stand.', b"Word of caution, my 11 year old son tried to put the legs on himself. Had he waited for his dad he would have learned that it was bent and the screw wasn't lining up right. My son, instead of waiting, muscled through and broke the rivet that the screw goes into. His dad, Maintenance Tech, was able to get it to work, but each leg only has 1 screw now. It works, seems sturdy and since it was so cheap we can buy another if we need to. He's got his laptop on it and it's working well.We purchased 2 of these, the other one was perfect and went together without any trouble. My 14 yr old put that one together.", b'This stand looks well-built and neat, easy assembly with clear instructions, all holes lined up. The one that I got had all the parts, including all the little rubber feet pieces. No bending under the weight of my monitor, everything looks good.I especially liked that this stand offers minimal rise (4" as opposed to 4 1/2 - 5" that many other stands do). For my purposes, even lower rise would be more desirable, but this one was the lowest I managed to find.I also like the fact that I can put my keyboard underneath when not in use. I specifically looked for a design that would allow that.The only thing is, if your desk top is even a little wobbly, like it\'s often the case with standing desks, then this stand (like any other stand, I believe) will unfortunately amplify the wobble.', b'Used this to raise a TiVo bolt DVR off the furniture to achieve better ventilation. This stand with the addition of an Affinity USB fan made a huge difference in the temp for around 25 bucks. Looking locally I would have spent around this  price for the stand alone. I like this stand because the surface is perfectly horizontal with no slant. Also the flat steel surface with holes is perfect to allow air flow under the TiVo which is the problem area. Laying the TiVo unit on a flat wooden surface leaves very little area under the unit for air to be expelled from the internal fan. This setup fixes the issue and the additional fan is just icing on the cake...', b'For what it is, it\'s great. The construction is solid and it holds my 28" Samsung screen nicely. I have a Macbook Pro and while it fits underneath, it has to sit on top of the two legs which is fine, more airflow underneath, but it just barely spans the gap. I get it, this isn\'t made specifically for Apple products but I thought I\'d put that out there for anyone else who might be interested. It\'s not big enough of a deal that I would return it though. For $11, this is a steal.', b'Exactly what I needed, for my laptop docking station/monitor combo at work! Saves losing desk space to my laptop. Just wide enough to accommodate a 15.6" Dell laptop. Feels very sturdy and took me maybe two minutes to assemble, using the enclosed hex wrench.']}

Fast delivery with signature requirement. Customer service A+. Spoke with them several times. I believe the store is located in Organ or California so I can call them anytime and understand the seller when he is speaking English!!!I dropped $1300 for this laptop. This is the most I ever paid for a laptop and this is my first Apple. This laptop is wickedly fast, awesome graphics, top processing speed (see the pictures). I can open ten webpages one after another and within seconds all of the pages would load. Same thing with streaming movies and surfing and typing at the same time.I am used to turn my old HP laptop on and do something else for 5 minutes until it loads but with this Apple it does not take more than a minute. The laptop I bought was sold as a "used item" but when I received it in the mail, I thought it was a brand new laptop, because there was not even a single scratch on the machine. It was so new as if it was just been taken out of the box. For a while, I thought that the seller (Double Dex MacBooks) has sent me a new laptop by mistake!I was a bit hesitant about the price. It was out of my normal speeding range but I was tired of non functioning Microsoft based laptops and I officially converted to Apple. Also, the seller (Double Dex MacBooks) can upgrade the components of their sold laptop (processor, battery, motherboard, memory) as long as I send the laptop back to them and pay them for the service. I really liked this option with this seller, since I can now keep this laptop and every few years have its parts upgraded without buying a new laptop. I am very happy with the product and the seller. I would recommend this seller to others.Cons:  Amazon descriptions says that the battery will last up to 7 hrs, it is more like 3 hrs. I did call and confirm with the seller about the battery before I bought the laptop and they said that battery only lasts only 2-3 hrs and the description on Amazon is not specific to each seller but rather a general product description taken from Apple website.', b"Got this computer as an upgrade from his 13 in / 4 gb RAM MacBookPro.  I called Double Dex MacBooks (the supplier) before ordering to be sure of all the details on the system and that I was getting what I really needed before placing the order. They were extremely helpful and I was confident in making a purchase from them.Once we got the computer - it showed up a couple days earlier than expected - it was in excellent shape. We transferred all the data, etc. over to the new machine and had 1 little glitch but something was causing a problem in one of our programs - 'Logic' - which was the main reason for getting a more powerful computer. My husband called up Double Dex MacBooks to get some input as whether it was the computer or a failure of a program to transfer correctly. It wasn't easily correctable over the phone or by directly accessing it so they invited him to send it in to be thoroughly checked-out and fixed or replaced, or he could come by their facility in Sacramento. Since we live barely an hour away he chose to go the next day.My husband can be VERY critical when it comes to computer issues but he fell in love with these guys. Once they checked out the system they spotted the problem right away and it was not the fault of the new computer - they fixed the install problem within 30 minutes of arrival!!  And - they bought his old computer on the spot.  Yeah!", b'The Double Dex Team delivered a winner.  The MacBook Pro, from start to finish was an easy purchase.  After discussing their products and Warranty via phone, prior to the purchase, I optimistically went ahead with my purchase, and we are extremely pleased.  The product works like a charm - very fast, and the typical Apple product, without a hitch.Double Dex will certainly get our future Apple product business.  We are very pleased with their customer interface and excellent MacBook Pro - and the price is a bargain.Thanks Double Dex!', b'Great computer, purchased the Mid June 2012 Macbook Pro which is fully upgradeable.Apple MacBook Pro 15.4-Inch Laptop Intel QuadCore i7 2.3GHz / 16GB DDR3 Memory / 1TB SSHD (Solid State Hybrid) Drive / 1.5GB Video Memory / OS X 10.10 Yosemite / ThunderBolt / USB 3.0 / DVD Burner. With the upgrade to a 1TB Solid State Drive this Mac is fast.', b"Great product! Works perfect. Ports, dvd drive, keyboard and trackpad are flawless. Everything arrived in excellent conditions. It is a fast machine, ideal for music and video editing. Minor (almost unperceptible) scratches.Fresh macOs sierra installed!New MagSafe included!I would strongly recommend the seller. I particularly identify myself with their recycling philosophy.About the display: the listed product was the one with the Glossy Display but they shipped the Anti-Glare one. I really didn't mind because I loved the anti-glare. It is more comfortable for the eyes and has great resolution! The only recommendation for the seller is to make that clear on the listing.P.S.: I already installed Mavericks on a second partition and works perfect. Also parallels with Windows running on it.", b'Three months of use and still working like a charm. On arrival the body was in perfect shape and the visual display looks good to my eyes (but then I\'m not one to obsess over HDTV\'s or Retina displays). I\'ve had no difficulty using memory-intensive programs like Photoshop or Logic, the latter is more likely to freeze up on my desktop than on this machine, and also appreciate the built-in DVD player and the variety of ports which saves money on adapters and dongles (I hate even being reminded that "dongle" is a word). While these features add some heft--if you want a featherweight laptop this is not the machine for you--I like that it feels well-nigh indestructible (versus my previous laptop, a Macbook Air, that was taken out by a spilled cup of coffee). I\'m glad I did some research and didn\'t spend 2K on a new 15" MB Pro.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

The fabric is light enough but certainly not flimsy and seems to be durable and the zippers all work exactly like they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to.  I got lucky and made a great choice for myself.  At least for how I\xe2\x80\x99m using it, I highly recommend this backpack.', b'Absolutely great backpack- holds a lot and very sturdy! You never know how much you need to pack, and this backpack is perfect for carrying school materials, travel stuff, you name it! Holds my laptop very snugly but not to the point where I have to worry about it being crushed by other stuff in the backpack!', b'This backpack is awesome. I recently made a trip to El Salvador and like to travel light. Well let me tell you, this pack is very roomy and comfortable. I bought a few souvenirs and everything fit inside. Take it I only spent 1 night there but no worries, no hassles. Lots of storage comprtments. Thanks KisGo!!', b'This bag is huge! I love it, it holds everything I need computer, gym bag, lunch and has a side place for a water bottle. It is perfect for my work commute.', b'Very Large and padded, functional, good pockets and seems sturdy.  I will update my review if it falls apart under heavy load.  The straps are stiff and well padded, the double side pockets are generous and the outside pencil pockets have good organizing liners.I\'m deducting one star for the finer points of the design, based on the last 7 years of use of a Swiss Gear pack.- the location of liner pockets make the pack top heavy, so when I set it down the pack falls over.- the outer large pocket could use a paper sleeve to help keep things seperated and the pencil pocket doesn\'t have enough pencils nor any usb pockets- the inner padded pocket holds a 17" laptop plus my ipad no problem, but the shape of the zipper is just a little tight at the top corners of the laptop which will cause a wear point on the zippers', b'This was worth the money.  I never had a back pack before.  Bought it because I needed support for my back when I have to carry my things to work.  Very well made.  Every inch of this bag has storage .  I love the padding in the back.  Also I was very impressed with the straps.  I recieved many compliments from my co-workers.  This bag is very durable.  Just a little bulky but I love it.  The color was what I wanted yes if you buy this back pack you will like it.']}

"Laptop For Dummies" makes it so much easier by providing tips and tricks to knowing, understanding, using and sometimes loving the power and capabilities of the laptop, it\'s new software upgrade, and the potential for improved use.This book is the 6th edition and the author, a PC guru, shares his experience and wisdom obtained over 2 decades in the industry to make the readers life easier by providing laptop info about:* purchase,* setup,* touring Windows 10- Start menu, programs, file storage, files from old computer,* file synchronization,* using Laptop for travel and/or business,* safe wi-fi usage,* managing battery power,* maintenance, troubleshooting and security tips.There\'s even more FUN stuff like uploading photos from smartphone or camera. All that and more are provided by the book itself, access to free Cheat Sheets for this book, Dummies Newsletters for an array of topics, technical and non-technical.', b'I had previously reviewed\xc2\xa0Computers For Seniors For Dummies\xc2\xa0and gave it 5 stars. I thought it was an excellent concise guide for just about anyone looking for an introduction to computer and/or making the leap to Windows 10 from a previous version. "Laptops for Dummies" offers pretty much the same thing (though the first few chapters are - obviously - laptop-centric). Though the two books are very similar, I didn\'t find them equal to the task. It\'s difficult to explain, but I found\xc2\xa0Computers For Seniors For Dummies\xc2\xa0more engaging and containing less fluff."Laptops for Dummies" spends the first six chapters (up to p. 78) introducing the laptop form factor. Interesting stuff (for a computer-oriented history buff), but I wonder how many people would find it valuable. I suspect most would skip right to Chapter 8 ("Your Laptop and Windows"). What about Chapter 7, you ask? Chapter 7 is devoted to a brief introduction to the tablet (PC). To my mind, this chapter has the potential to be more filler (at best) or confusing (at worst) for the type person needing this book.So the book really starts on p. 93. From this point on it\'s pretty much the same as\xc2\xa0Computers For Seniors For Dummies\xc2\xa0and - I suspect - Mr. Gookin\'s\xc2\xa0PCs For Dummies\xc2\xa0(where the current rating, btw, is similar to how I\'ve rated this book). Given the intended audience are those who really, really, really know next to almost nothing about computers I wonder if the book could confuse more than not. The author spends quite a bit of time introducing and explaining various ports and parts of the laptop, but the discussion on Windows (etc.) assumes a level of knowledge and confidence that is higher than the level assumed about laptops.In the end, just not sure the book works well enough to justify the cost ($25 retail seems pretty steep; $15 seems far more appropriate with an Amazon price no higher than $10). But as with\xc2\xa0Computers For Seniors For Dummies\xc2\xa0I plan on keeping it around: I\'m sure it will be a useful addition to my counseling job where I often deal with clients who find computers necessary but overwhelming. Likewise, I bet this would be a helpful addition to the libraries of senior centers, adult continuing ed centers, etc.P.S. one of the best nuggets is found on p. 96 where the author describes the "start" screen in Windows 10 and names the "app panel" that pops up the "\'What the Hell?\' Area." Perfect. Spot on. Also, see p. 51 where the author addresses how easy (not) it is to migrate data in Windows 10. Priceless.', b'I love the "For Dummies" line for almost everything but computer hardware related stuff. It isn\'t that I don\'t like it, but more that my expectations when it comes to hardware is high. Maybe too high. I note that at the beginning of review as a sort of a grain of salt warning.I selected this book because I got a new laptop for Christmas. My first laptop in years because my last one drove me nuts. It is Windows 10 and just seems a bit wonky at times so when I saw this book become available, I decided to take a look. Upon review, there are some things that were new to me. Like I realized that I had the monitor at the wrong angle and I did like the power saver information. For a beginner, this is a good book for overview. If an intermediate to advanced (I\'d put myself firmly at intermediate), the content may seem redundant. For example, I don\'t really want to know the history of the laptop."Laptops for Dummies" is a nice intro book but I was expecting more.', b'Like so many Dummies books, this one really  is for dummies, people who are totally new to using a laptop computer. Much of the book, in reality, has to do with adapting to Windows 10 if you are moving up from Windows 7 or an earlier version. The first chapter, which is a history of the march toward today\xe2\x80\x99s laptops was amusing. Of the numerous computers described, I had owned all but one, and that one was a vision more than a product. Frankly I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who the audience for this book is, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not really my concern, is it? Author Dan Gookin has been writing about various aspects of computers and computing for decades and he is a competent craftsman. The writing is clear even if it follows all the all too often too cute Dummies style book. If  you know someone who actually doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to even turn on a laptop computer, this is a good place to point them.Jerry']}

I\'m more concerned about processing speed when compiling large amounts of code as opposed to its graphics. The screen is good, the 7th gen mobile I7 (near top of the line for the genre) is what I bought it for. The 12 GB of memory is good to have out of the box as opposing to have to upgrade.Other notes:* I immediately replaced the 1TB hard drive with a 512 GB  Samsung SSD.  Not because the hard drive is bad , its actually a decent 7200 RPM drive, but not be near the performance of an SSD. For most people should be just fine with the drive it came with.* As stated before this is not a gaming laptop, if you are looking for high FPS this will not have it, but neither does it advertise itself as being a gaming laptop.* It has been very solid running windows 10, which I upgraded from the "home" to "pro" as I need remote access to it.* The Passmark score I get on the unit with an SSD is ~ 3500 with the main detractor being the graphics card.* For the price point, and understanding the purpose and intended use , this is a very capable laptop* The lack of a DVD/CD drive is pretty common now, so I don\'t detract stars for that. Considering how rarely most now use optical media no biggie, cheap USB external optical drives all over the place. Also , if you download ISO CD images , remember that Win 10 can mount them as a drive without having to burn them to disk (unless you want to)Bottom line, I don\'t think I wasted money on this laptop.', b"As a gamer and an IT professional I really need to have a good computer so I decided to update mine now.3 years ago I bought a HP Envy 15 (core i7 4th gen, 16gb ram ddr3, GeForce 740m, touch, beats audio) and it served me well, except for the fact that the cooling fan broke at the 2nd year, and I had to replace it. Also the graphics card wasn't able to give me a good performance in some games such as Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 or Killer Instinct.After doing some really intense research I read many reviews and watched several benchmarks of laptops such as dell Inspiron 7577 (GeForce GTX 1060 6GB), dell 5000 series (GTX 1050 4GB), hp omen and so on. However many of these laptops weren't the best choice for me, some because of the bad reviews (poor build, case falling apart), the design (don't wanna go too crazy) or the price. In fact I didn't want to spend 1500-2000$ on a laptop to have 16gb RAM, a good Graphics Processor and an i7. Since I also have a video game console to play, I wanted a solid good computer where I can do my work and play my games without having to struggle too much on performance settings.After getting this and doing some tests I can say this laptop is just amazing. It has a solid build and a beautiful design.The keyboard is solid, the screen is really sharp (I had to set up color calibration because it was a little bit too green) and much better than the previous laptop. I can even see the details of the tiny characters in League of Legends now. The sound is amazing (not as much as Bose speakers but still very good). The touch pad is very nice and smooth. Since it has a SSD it turns on in 10 seconds.I didn't test many games yet but Killer Instinct, Fortnite, League of Legends and Naruto 4 run at 60fps steady (Max Settings).Even in scenarios with many particles and effects.In short it is the best thing you will get in this price range.PS: Unfortunately for the first time I had a bad experience with Amazon itself.My product was packed in a box 4 times bigger than the laptop box and left in a random market instead of an UPS facility.Also The metal stripe below the card reader slot arrived bent in the opposite direction of the laptop. Not a big deal, but still not happy about it.", b"I really like this computer, it does what I need it to do, but after charging, and having a FULL charge; within an hour (without streaming anything, no music, no videos, nothing that would drain the battery) I find that I have to plug it in to a power source (aka outlet) in order to continue working. I've never had a battery drain so quickly! That is my ONLY complaint on this computer. PATHETIC BATTERY LIFE!

{'asin': 'B004AB70US', 'title': 'Amazon.com: Samsonite Classic Two Gusset 17" Toploader, Black', 'price': '', 'tech': '', 'reviews': [b'Everything I was looking for in a laptop case & at a more affordable price than in stores, which didn\'t have a 17.3" model that was as good as this one! Pockets for computer & other accessories, ample space for legal files in a divided pocket, other small zipper pockets, & mountable on your luggage handle. Very satisfied with this purchase that I will (try to) share photos in a minute...1 flaw though! ...It isn\'t leather. :D ...but that\'s not what I paid for. A durable leather version would be AWESOME"." Of which I wouldn\'t mind shelling out double the price, or more...[Additional Edit] After moving some stuff (mouse, mouse-pad, & HDMI cable) from my old Targus 15.6 laptop case into this new one, I MUST ADD that the quality of this case is BY FAR superior. It feels real durable & rugged, but at the same time it is VERY lean, neat, & classy (professional looking). I\'d also like to add that my Galaxy S2 phone in its\' own HUGE case [I.e. Premium Heavy Duty Hybrid Case Cover (Outer Silicone Rubber Skin + Inner Durable Hard Shell W/Kickstand); also available on Amazon] fits right into the cell phone holder in the 2nd pocket (which itself has an inner additional zipper pocket).Fully loaded, the case is comfortable when worn with the shoulder strap; whether worn simply over a shoulder or over the head to the opposite shoulder. I foresee no problems cycling with this case worn as such on my way to the public & law libraries, nor walking to & from public transportation.If you\'re concerned about your laptop fitting into this case, my HP dv7-7250us fits just fine.', b'I searched for a new, larger laptop computer case when I got my 17" HP Envy notebook computer. I read about the bags, looked at pictures, went to stores to look at them, and read reviews. I found a consumer guide that rated this product #1, a Case Logic model #2, and the Three Gusset 17 Samsonite Classic #3. I already liked this Samsonite Classic Two Gusset 17" as my first choice. The features of #1 and #2 were about the same. #3 is wider, and has an extra compartment for files, clothes, etc. I chose the Samsonite Classic 17 Two Gusset, and have used it, and I love it. The Samsonite build-quality is outstanding. It looks good, and works good. The middle compartment is where the computer goes. It is retained in a padded envelope with a Velcro retaining strap. In that compartment, there are three pockets for peripherals drives, CD-DVD\'s, directional recording devices, or other items. I used those three pockets for cords, adapters, mouse, and my Pocketalker hearing device. The pockets are big enough to neatly place more than one item in each pocket. These pockets are separated from the computer by the computer padding. The back compartment is for document files, magazines, paper tablets, etc. The back pocket has two dividers, and a couple inches of room. I put in files, tablets, and my iPad in the back compartment. The front zipper compartment has pockets inside for cell phone or calculator, pens, business or credit cards, and room for miscellaneous items...flash drives, miscellaneous office supplies like clips and post-its, high-lighters, breath mints. The smaller front sipper compartment is great for important papers like hotel reservations, plane tickets, car rental docs, and directions to event centers. Mine is not used, and I know how I like to fill and organize it. I like the fact that the case is firm and holds it\'s shape, and the fabric appears to be indestructible. The should strap works perfectly, and the handles are comfortable. If you need more room inside, as in clothes or many big files, I\'d select the Samsonite Classic Three Gusset, but this one is perfect for me. Amazon price was about 1/3 of MSRP. A great buy.', b'High-quality fabric and handle connections, doesn\'t look like they\'ll break down for a long time.  All of the strap clips and zipper pulls are metallic, and it has four external pockets - two zippered ones on the front, and a zippered one plus a velcro-held slot behind it on the back.  It\'s wide enough that it fits my giant 17" Asus laptop easily, without me having to finagle it into the bag (my laptop is a little over 16" wide, and 10-3/4" long).  The laptop pocket has a stretchy velcro strap to hold it more snugly in place, as well as three pockets that can easily fit a gigantic AC adapter and a mouse.  The other side has a divider, and is perfect for holding papers; it zips down halfway on each side you you can open it wide to access things.  I\'ve even fit two hard-bound lab notebooks and a 1-in binder inside that pocket, all at the same time.  It holds quite a lot.', b"If you go to the Samsonite company sites, you will find that there are six or seven of these bags with almost the same configuration and not always the clearest measurements.  I needed a bag for a 17.3-inch laptop and wanted an extra slot or two for iPad and other gadgets.  This bags fits my HP 17.3 perfectly (although there may be one of the similar bags which is slightly larger if you want more room still.)  The Samsonite construction and materials is good and there's plenty of room for other stuff.  I'm happy.", b'This was an upgrade from my Case Logic 17" laptop bag. I\'d had it for years and years, still looks like new, but my job requires me to carry more stuff than it can handle... plus, it wasn\'t particularly comfortable to lug around everywhere (lack of padding). So, I grabbed this one and I couldn\'t be more pleased. Quality construction. Excellent travel bag. The padded strap is wonderful for my shoulders. And this toploader has almost double the space my Case Logic one had, which was the most important thing. In addition to the comfort and size, it\'s a toploader, which makes things INFINITELY easier at airport checkpoints. My Case Logic had to be completely unzipped, and the velcro retaining strap undone to get the laptop out. Bottom line: Samsonite made a quality laptop case that I would highly recommend to anyone who travels.']}

It's 2 sided, one for eating the other more of a desk type surface. I don't think I'd put a huge drink on it, but to hold my In N' Out burger and fries it's perfect.", b"It works exactly as described on the product page. It attaches onto the bottom of your steering wheel and the pressure of your items holds it in place. One side of the tray has an indentation to hold  a cup and keep it from sliding off the tray and the other side is smooth for either a laptop or tablet, or to use as a writing surface and has a pen or pencil holder. It doesn't look like it would hold a laptop, but it does. Easy to get onto the steering wheel and easy to get off. A great product for home health/hospice nurses or others who work out of their car. I use it to do my charting in my car and not have to sit in my patient's homes and do it. I use it 5 days a week and wonder how I have lived without it.", b'Bought it hoping it would work and it would be sturdy is that an more.  It fits all the cars in my house Smart Car, Blazer, Crown Vic and Toyota PIck up truck.  I bought it mainly for on the road paper work and eating, as I travel all over for work and my car is my office more often than not.  This tray is sturdy and holds up pretty good.  I have used my lap tops on it a 10\xe2\x80\x9d and a 13\xe2\x80\x9d with no problem.  My coworker sbought one for a Lexus and a Toyota Scion.  The tray has two sides, a eating tray or a working tray both work great!', b"Heavy duty, it won't break. I drive about 30,000 miles a year in my Honda Element and use this all the time when I have to eat on the road. It is great. It will fit any standard size or type of steering wheel the design is amazingly simple and effective. It also gives you a 'mini-desk' when you are not eating, great for doing paperwork. Easy to clean, I love it.", b"I wasn't sure about buying this but I needed something for my lunches. Since the weather has warmed and its nicer out I wanted to be able to eat in my truck on my lunch breaks. I found this while looking on Amazon and I decided to give it a try. It just slips onto the bottom of your steering wheel and stays put. I even pushed on it very hard and gave it a lot of pressure trying to dislodge it and it didn't budge. I tried again, pushed down and nothing. I put my food and drinks on it and ate very comfortably without having to awkwardly hold my food with one hand and eat with the other hand. I sent a picture to my sister who was also impressed. I'm glad I bought it.", b"I purchased this recently so haven't had a lot of time to work with it.  It seems to work well- much as  other reviewers have described.  I purchased it to  set up my  smaller painting kits in order to be able to paint from the driver's seat of my car. Sometimes moving to the passenger's side doesn't work- for viewing and because I am right handed. This way I can keep other equipment in the center console too. I think this will work well.  As I am  far more plump that I should be,  I had to readjust the seat and the wheel, but that was easy to do and easy to get back into  my regular driving position.  I thumped around and pushed down on the tray a lot and it held its position well and seemed very sturdy. I also appreciated that I didn't have to rotate the steering wheel to upside down to get this to attach (some other brands say you need to do this with their similar products).  If this doesn't work out well, I'll change my review.  In the meantime, I'm looking forward to using it a lot !!!", b'If you work or spend any time in your car with a laptop or fast food, you have to get this. It\'s study, cheap, no moving parts, locks onto and comes off of any steering wheel with ease. It will last forever. And, it fits in my laptop bag. Perfect size, lightweight. See photos for better size and to see how it fits on my 2000 Dodge Caravan. It can double as a "tray" when I\'m camping too. I like that I can put it on even grungy picnic tables and know my food is clean. So many potential ways to use it outside the van I may need to buy another one!', b"Been using this for a few months now, and I LOVE it. It's easy to clean, easy to flip, and I've managed to get it to stay up on my steering wheel with no risk of anything falling (although I was worried, but really, it never even came close) at nearly any position I've had the wheel turned at. Works well both for my heavy laptop and for eating. Wipes clean easily. I've used it for typing up a few papers, making jewelry, and eating lunch. I've also used it as a car seat snack desk, letting my LO hold it in her front-facing to have a bowl of cereal with milk (I'm brave, I know), and also a few bowls of soup. It didn't come out completely spill free, but that's to be expected, and it definitely was a much cleaner process than if I'd gone without anything. Always has prevented spills from going anywhere off of it when using it attached to my steering wheel, though. Couldn't have made a better choice, glad I don't live any more days without it. It also fits well in my very overstuffed back seat pocket."]}

I have never purchased refurbished before so I really didn't know what to expect, though was greatly concerned.  Needless to say that this laptop heavily exceeded my expectations.  Other reviewers stated that their MacBook was not as described, though mine looks brand new.  The keys are still crisp and clean, the screen immaculate.  There are a few light scratches on the outside of the computer (mostly the underside), but it is very minimal and unnoticeable.It runs like a dream, though I have only begun using it.  I will update should the computer have any issues.  It is an early 2015 with 4 GB RAM and its OS is Sierra.

We bought it for Christmas, and it has several different modes. The only reason I am docking it a star is because the little red "mouse" on the right side of the toy says "UP, LEFT, RIGHT" but when you pull it "DOWN" it doesn\'t say "DOWN!" .... Pretty strange seeing how this is a educational kids toy? Other than that, the lights and sounds are pretty good.', b'I like this toy - and more importantly my son likes it. But I think as a lot of parents know, some toys just have irritating songs. I find myself at work singing "My first laptop is so fun, its made just for meeeee..." and so on. Also, a characteristic of some other VTech toys in my house, the toy likes to make noise even when not in use unless its switched to Off (And who has a toddler that remembers to switch their toys off?) ... Not me!', b'This toy keeps my son entertained for so long! There are also different settings so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to listen to the same songs over and over \xf0\x9f\x98\x82. The buttons are only at the bottom of the laptop and not on the \xe2\x80\x9cscreen\xe2\x80\x9d part. They do light up though. Super happy with this purchase.', b"My 3.5 month year old LOVES this! She can use the little mouse and push the buttons. It's adorable. The only thing that is a little annoying is that the top falls closed. Since my little one can't sit up yet, we are usually using it as she is propped up or laying down and if I don't keep my finger on the screen to hold it open, it will fall down.", b"This entertained my 6 month old for about a year so I think it was worth it. My other son was 1 1/2 when we bought it and it didn't interest him all too much. I would recommend buying it for babies, but not so much toddlers older than 1 1/2 yrs old. I like that it had different settings, and that is why I think it held my younger son's attention for so long because you could change it up.", b'My kids still play with this and my youngest is nearly 7. So, I bought it for some friends of ours. The baby is new, but they both work from home with laptops as I did when mine were little. I think they will have plenty of pictures with the little one using his laptop right next to them.', b"Sometimes you only discover problems with certain products when you get them home. First off, this is a wonderful toy, my daugther does get genuine enjoyment out of it, and the keys are soft enough that she can sit up and bang away on it independently, which is kind of nice. She loves the sounds, and can spend a lot of time playing on it, which is also nice. It is a great learning tool, and she likes it very much.Here is the problem, and the makers of this, V-tech that is you, should really have paid more attention to the fact that this also causes my baby much frustration because the top hatch to the laptop has a very very bad habit of closing while she is in the middle of playing with it!! this frustrates her to no end, and she is at age where you can see her annoyance with this thing through her actions.  She will let out a howl, and bang on the laptop to get her mother's attention to open it for her again.Though there appears to be no danger in her fingers getting injured, it is quite silly for the quality testers to not have noticed this flaw. If they did, they did not care, and figured what was the big deal. Well, if you or I were working on a MAC, and as we are typing the screen kept flipping down on you, you would howl in frustration to and give Apple a piece of your mind.  It would be considered defective.Hopefully on future versions, they will correct this, because other wise, it is a pretty good product."]}

Some quick points -1. The screen is underwhelming- It is a TN display (and not IPS), which means that  colors look washed out if the display isn\'t in the most "optimal" position.- The screen is pretty glossy. Need to crank the brightness up just to hide the annoying reflections- The resolution is too low.  This is especially noticeable when using it in tablet mode, since the screen tends to be closer to the face when doing so,2. The half-sized right shift key is annoying.  I\'m still adapting my typing style to it, even after 2 months of usage.3. The keyboard quality is great.  The feedback, key sizes etc are pretty good.4. No lags or slowdowns in normal usage (office apps, browsing etc) despite it sporting only a Pentium CPU.  Any slowdowns are actually due to the HDD - but even this not bad.', b"This is a great starter laptop for a non-power user. We bought this for my 9 year old daughter to use for school and fun, and it's met those needs well. I wouldn't try to run complicated graphic-intense games on it, but for writing papers and watching annoying YouTube videos, it is just right.", b'This is one of those laptops that does some things very well and frustrates me greatly on other minor aspects. I did think of returning this thing but decided I can live with the flaws, but I guess you be the judge.Let me start with the pros:1) I like the feel of the keyboard; it\'s solid and doesn\'t feel cheap at all.2) For the price, I like the fact that it has a 14" screen, 500gb hard drive, and it\'s less than 4 pounds. Sure beats the other notebooks of its category that use a solid state drive of like only 64gb or 128gb storage capacity. Having 500gb is great because I can store all my music files totaling 200gb and more.3) I like the overall performance with video and audio streaming (with YouTube and Pandora); it is actually excellent.4) Screen color quality is good, no complaints there.Now the cons:1) Whoever designed this keyboard ought to be fired! The right Shift key was halved in width so that what would normally be its left half is the up arrow key instead! I am a touch typist who types 100+wpm, and this bothers me to end. While typing in this review, I had already accidentally pressed the Up arrow key instead of the Shift key about 5 times. Sorry, but I have to say whoever designed and allowed this kind of a keyboard design to get through are clearly not touch typists and are idiots.2) This laptop has a graphics driver issue even with its latest driver. If your wallpaper is not the exact size of the screen resolution, be ready to see your wallpaper occasionally display as all white with tiny gray dots all over. The maximum screen resolution of this laptop is 1377x768. If your wallpaper is like 1920x1080, be ready to see this occasional symptom. It doesn\'t happen all the time, but often enough to annoy you. And when it does happen, your wallpaper will not get restored until the next wallpaper refresh; if you can\'t wait till then, just go to Background in the Settings and it will refresh. But if you use a wallpaper with 1377x768, you will not get this problem.3) Another graphics driver issue is that when using the Google Chrome browser, if the page is heavy with graphics, and you switched to some other application and then back to the browser, expect the client area of the browser to *sometimes* be pitch black. The way to correct this is simply to resize the browser, and the client area will be repainted/refreshed. I am using Google Chrome in like 4 to 5 other computers regularly, never have I ever seen this kind of a problem.I called up Lenovo technical support for this several times, and after downloading the driver, it got stuck at installation. To make a long story short, the tech guy told me to reinstall the reset the operating system to factory conditions, but it didn\'t get rid of the problem.As you can see, the problems are not major, but they\'re extremely annoying. I decided not to return this because of what you get for the price, I got a lightweight notebook with decent storage capacity, something I couldn\'t find without having to settle for an inadequate 64gb or 128gb solid state drive.', b"Buy far the best purchase during the Holiday season...returned 2 other laptops and got this one...it's really fun!  Has a lot of nice features, and it does everything I need it to do...", b'for the money and a dedicated use of excel and windows may be ok - slow to bring up applications and run them - not a good multitasking machine - audio a bit weak ok with headset - screen is vary narrow view and brightness not as good as it should be - again for the $ and my dedicated use OK - if buying again I would still look to Lenovo but a higher end unit with more memory - thinking about designing a boot to cover key pad when folded in the tablet configuration to protect it and provide a good base', b'Perfect laptop for the average college student! Amazing battery life for the cost, decently fast for a computer this price, sleek and not bulky and the touch screen/tablet feature is fun and convenient. The screen is a bit meh and causes glare in a well lit room but other than that its great. Will NOT find a better computer for this price and i have looked at all of them so take my word for it.', b"This is a well-built laptop with many great features and a terrific price - but with only 4GB of RAM and a relatively slow HDD.  Depending on your apps, you may find it is frustratingly slow to become responsive again after waking from sleeping.  I recommend also buying an 8GB DRAM upgrade for about $60.  It completely eliminates the slowdowns and it's still a great price.", b'I am still learning all of the cool tricks this 2 n 1 laptop/tablet has. I did not think this Lenovo could do so much. The screen is super bright and clear, and it sits in about a zillion different positions. The battery life is quite adequate and movie watching is great, especially the Harmon Kardon speakers make the media experience amazing.The touch screen is very responsive and I love having a touchscreen on my tablet. But the best thing about this great computer was its price. It might seem a little heavy but with all of the positions it utilizes the weight does not pose a problem whatsoever.It is a wonderful, useful, very cool computer.']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast.

It is well padded, has lockable zippers on both large compartments, good padding in the laptop sleeve, and several smaller compartments with nice dividers to keep everything organized.  It has a charger plug in for charging phones, etc. on the go.  It has a sturdy strap for attaching to the handle of luggage, making it possible to pull it , rather than wear it through an airport.  It has plenty of room to use as a weekend bag for traveling.  The material is heavy duty without being too heavy.  I highly recommend it.', b'I took my time in choosing a laptop backpack to use everyday but will also be used for a trip to Europe. This bag fits all my requirements and I\xe2\x80\x99m really liking it. The shoulder straps are comfortable and there are plenty of pockets to carry all my stuff.', b'I wanted a backpack that would hold a large assortment of office supplies and paperwork for me that I could keep in my van for field work I do.  I wanted it to be durable, roomy and have a lot of compartments.  When I received this backpack and started checking it out I was blown away by how many pockets and compartments it has from large to small.  It\xe2\x80\x99s been perfect for me and I love it.  How durable it will be I can\xe2\x80\x99t say yet \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it less than a month \xe2\x80\x94 but so far durability doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be a concern.  The fabric is light enough but certainly not flimsy and seems to be durable and the zippers all work exactly like they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to.  I got lucky and made a great choice for myself.  At least for how I\xe2\x80\x99m using it, I highly recommend this backpack.', b'Absolutely great backpack- holds a lot and very sturdy! You never know how much you need to pack, and this backpack is perfect for carrying school materials, travel stuff, you name it! Holds my laptop very snugly but not to the point where I have to worry about it being crushed by other stuff in the backpack!', b'This backpack is awesome. I recently made a trip to El Salvador and like to travel light. Well let me tell you, this pack is very roomy and comfortable. I bought a few souvenirs and everything fit inside. Take it I only spent 1 night there but no worries, no hassles. Lots of storage comprtments. Thanks KisGo!!', b'This bag is huge! I love it, it holds everything I need computer, gym bag, lunch and has a side place for a water bottle. It is perfect for my work commute.', b'Very Large and padded, functional, good pockets and seems sturdy.  I will update my review if it falls apart under heavy load.  The straps are stiff and well padded, the double side pockets are generous and the outside pencil pockets have good organizing liners.I\'m deducting one star for the finer points of the design, based on the last 7 years of use of a Swiss Gear pack.- the location of liner pockets make the pack top heavy, so when I set it down the pack falls over.- the outer large pocket could use a paper sleeve to help keep things seperated and the pencil pocket doesn\'t have enough pencils nor any usb pockets- the inner padded pocket holds a 17" laptop plus my ipad no problem, but the shape of the zipper is just a little tight at the top corners of the laptop which will cause a wear point on the zippers', b'This was worth the money.  I never had a back pack before.  Bought it because I needed support for my back when I have to carry my things to work.  Very well made.  Every inch of this bag has storage .  I love the padding in the back.  Also I was very impressed with the straps.  I recieved many compliments from my co-workers.  This bag is very durable.  Just a little bulky but I love it.  The color was what I wanted yes if you buy this back pack you will like it.']}

In fact, I'm playing one now and have been using this mouse. Please remember this is a cheap mouse and probably like most of you kind folk, bought this because of the eye candy glowing YUMMINESS.The Pro's:- Works on Microsoft 10- Smooth turning. I have no problems like the user M W had when moving the mouse really fast- VERY yummy colors and not only does it go through the rainbow, there are many times where multiple colors are glowing at once (vid doesn't capture it yet, I guess)- The scroll wheel does have ticks, and it's a softer feeling than some others, which I appreciate- Literally got it today, took it out of the box, plugged the USB into my laptop and instant usage. I did have to change the mouse speed setting to my preference.- Shape of the mouse is fine, no issues or complaints- I lightly grip my mouse, so I do not feel the cut outs/grip slits on the side of the mouse that others may complain aboutThe Cons:- Feels like a cheap mouse. It's very lightweight, lighter than my mini Logictech. Feels like nothing is inside and it's all cheap plastic. You'll feel the cheapness as soon as you start clicking.- I personally don't like mice with wires, so I'd love to see a wireless version- When not lit up the pattern looks...not so nice. Surprising how much the glowing colors sell this thing.- The very top tip of the mouse can't quite light up like the rest. I assume the light doesn't reach that far up. This is a small con.Honestly there is nothing that I'm absolutely disappointed in when I purchased this for $10. Biggest gripe is that it's so light.I hope my review helped you make a decision !", b"I originally bought another mouse that was 30 dollars made by Bloody and I returned it to get this 10 dollar one instead. I don't regret my decision. I've only used it for a couple of hours and it already feels great. I wanted something that was colorful but could still handle playing video games online like League of Legends. Does it feel cheap? Yeah I mean it's pretty cheap, you can tell it is. But it handles well, moves good, and clicks way better than the other one I had bought. This mouse is definitely not something you'd throw around because it's lighter plastic.", b'I bought this for my wife as a replacement to my Microsoft mouse we have had for well over 10 years.Came packaged very nicely in it\'s own little box. No drivers required. Plugged it in and it worked like a champ. The mouse is quite light (I\'m used to rather heavy gaming mouses) so if you are looking for something with a little weight to it, this is definitely not for you. The braided cord is quite a nice touch on a mouse at this price point. All the buttons and clicks have a nice quality feel. The side buttons are very easy to push and require very little pressure to activate. The click sound is a bit on the loud side but I think that will calm down with use. The mouse wheel feels on par with my $100 gaming mouse, very nice, very smooth and does not take much effort to get it to do exactly what you want it to do. The colors I have to say are pretty sweet, not quite something I would get but my wife and kids were rather impressed and they enjoy it a lot (almost too much). The colors don\'t change too fast and they aren\'t distracting while reading the screen but you definitely notice the mouse from a distance.The size of the mouse is pretty perfect as well. I am 6\'2" and I prefer my mouse with a little girth and this thing has some. It fits comfortably in the palm of my hand without having to cup my hand or hover over the mouse and use it with my finger tips.Overall, at this price point, I am second guessing my choice of gaming mouse. It\'s perfect for games if you are on a budget.', b"I love this mouse! I got when I a new desktop a few months back because I hate how small the standard mouses are. This mouse actually fits my hand comfortably and it works very well for gaming. For reference, I'm a female with medium sized hands. Not to mention it looks pretty darn cool! There is no way to turn off the lights without unplugging it from the desktop though. This mouse lights up pretty bright, so if you are light sensitive and have your computer in your bedroom, it may cause issues for you when you're trying to sleep. I am light sensitive but luckily I have my desktop(and my mouse) in a rolltop desk, so I can't see the constantly changing, bright light of the mouse when I'm trying to sleep.HOWEVER, I have recently come across a potentially fatal issue with this mouse. It seems as if it is having random technical issues, and sometimes will point up and spin for a second or two. This has happened twice. It's not that big of an issue, unless you're playing a game. Which is what I was doing both times that it happened. It's quite disorienting when you're in a game to have your mouse suddenly make you look up and spin and can easily cost you the whole game! I'm hoping those two times were just flukes, but if it keeps happening I'll be forced to replace this mouse with one that doesn't randomly spin. Pretty useless as a gaming mouse if you can't trust that it'll always do what you want it to do.Will update this review if I end up replacing the mouse or if the spinning stops.", b"I'm very happy with my new computer mouse (which arrived today). Not only did it arrive extremely early, it was better than expected! The mouse has a bit of weight to it which I like, so it doesn't feel chintzy like some mouses do. It feels nice in my hand and has great input latency. And for those who are wondering about the LED's, the colors fade from one to the next ranging in blue, green, pink, purple, and red (with a bit of orange). Overall a great product for a great price."]}

The touch screen works great, its very convenient for when you wanna use your computer but don\xe2\x80\x99t really wanna deal with a keyboard(which is why I bought a 2-in-1). Especially if you don\xe2\x80\x99t own a tablet(like me). It has Pretty good battery life. A Overall good high performance computer for somebody who needs something a little more than just a average laptop. It\xe2\x80\x99s the best computer I ever had. I Love it.']}

The performance boost from an SSD (even a low end SSD) will far outweigh many other upgrades including additional RAM. This system is a perfect combination of processor + RAM + SSD for the price. When you purchase, be sure to check for updates in Settings -> Update and Security for the latest Windows 1511 build that was released. The update will take some time to install but when installed it will improve speed by about 30% for startup and regular usage.Pros:System has a good low end quad-core processor.SSD is great for speed.15.6" display looks goodSystem is relatively light given its size.Windows 10HDMI outCons:Limited storage space (not meant for those looking to store large amounts of pictures/videos/music)No DVD optical driveCharging cable has very thin connector to system, can be broken fairly easily.Feels cheap, though not as bad as you would think at this price point.Bottom Line:If you\'re looking for a low end system with no frills just to get basic day to day computing done or for school work, this is a great system for you. Get an external hard drive to store your pictures and videos and you\'ll be all set!', b'love this computer and the price. have had no problem with it being slow or freezing up. i can even multi task with it and it is awsome. love the led screen aswell.', b"I've been using the laptop for several weeks now.  I like it.  I wish I'd paid attention that it was NOT touch screen.  Would have preferred . . . BUT for those who have voiced complaints about sticky/whatever keys/etc.  I found it took a few days for the computer to adjust to my touch/ or more likely me to adjust to its response.  With a little use, the keys issue vanished.", b"Do not buy this PC.  Very slow, for no reason; even when I've closed background programs and deleted all programs that were not necessary. Literally runs like if the computer is constantly under heavy loads, even for regular web browsing.  I got this laptop to do VERY SIMPLE documents on word and excel and it can barely handle it. If you want a PC to piss you off constantly and make you wish you got a better one, this is the choice for you. The power button didnt even light up out of the box.  The box it came in did not look tampered with meaning this laptop was just made poorly BY CHOICE.Stay away.  I've had this laptop for almost a year now, I did not write the review sooner because I don't use it often, and thought it was in my head.  This piece of trash has been confirmed.", b"I got this laptop knowing that it wasn't high end because I needed something to be able to take to public wifi to job hunt and do various things online. It was incredibly slow when I got it, so I removed a bunch of apps and programs that came on it and installed ones that I like. In general now the computer itself runs fine, but there is something with either the internet or my choice of browser that it does not like. I do not like the new Windows based browser, and have been using Firefox for a decade with no problems. If I open too many tabs on this, the entire thing slows down or freezes up. I am using the same internet that I have with my other computer, so I don't think that is the variable that is causing this problem. It does what I need, and I can Skype on it with my daughter as long as nothing else is running. The audio is not great, but I think that has more to do with the way it comes out the bottom front of the machine, it is easy to muffle depending on what it's sitting on. There is something weird about the keyboard, and the distance between keys that I am still getting used to four months later.All in all, it's a decent machine for the money.", b"Don't waste your money on this! It is so slow! Right when I first got it and booted it up, was pegged at 100% cpu and disk  without me downloading or installing a single program, due to all the pre installed garbage they put on it, and it remained pegged until I shut it down, which wasn't for hours later. Spend the extra money and get the same laptop with core i3 instead, that's what I did, and they are like totally different laptops, even though just the cpu is different.", b'I was really looking forward to this laptop. Unfortunately it has had nothing but problems. The charger is not a factory Dell Charger and will not charge battery, the sound card has never worked and the processing speed is on the level of something 10 years old. I wish I could get a full refund because this has not worked like a new computer since day one I would have been better off going with a refurbished one at this price point. It takes 10x as long as any computer I have owned to do the most simplistic of tasks. If the seller sees this and can replace with a better option or make this right I would love to change my review but at this point I am extremely dissatisfied with this computer.', b"This laptop is terrible.  First there were intermittent problems with the USB ports where they would not respond to the mouse.  Then the internal socket for the power supply separated from the case and I was left with a hole through which I could see into the inside of the laptop.  The customer service was just as bad and the person I spoke to had poor English skills and finally told me that the missing power socket wasn't covered by the warranty.  Then some of the keyboard keys would not work, so I used an external keyboard.  Lastly, the speaker sound started to produce noise.I was in Louisiana when the  socket broke and looked for  factory authorized repair service.  The closest one was 800 miles away in Texas.I would advise you to PASS THIS ONE BY."]}

It works seamlessly on my Windows 10 laptop that does not have a DVD burner. It is very fast because you can optionally connect it to two USB 3.0 connections which provide exceptional power. I searched over a dozen of these and this is definitely the best one.', b"This was absolutely THE most simple and easy installation of an external disc drive. My new company laptop (awesome, expensive, 4K screen yet no disc drive) lacks a disc drive. What it does have is plenty of USB 3.0 ports so hooking this up was super simple. Now using this as a quasi external hard drive via DVD's might not need USB 3.0 because I'm not sure it needs USB 3.0 but it's always nice to have. Now that I think about it, this is great for USB 3.0 because the 3.0 standard provides more voltage than USB 2.0 (a significant amount). Nonetheless, I plugged this in and did not have to do anything concerning drivers. It was plug and play...my laptop is Windows 7 Enterprise. I used it to install a driver via disc for a copier.Also, I tested this in my Windows 10 Professional desktop and it was the same...no manual driver updates or anything. I plugged it in, let the system automatically find the correct drivers and boom, perfect. Then I installed Fallout 4 for my kid to play and all was right with the world.This is a very good disc drive and it's quick. It is similar to one made by iClever as well but it's slimmer and more simple to connect. It's a good deal for a great product. Highly recommended!", b"Currently unavailable? That's a shame if you're looking an external drive. This drive offers some very nice features.The first thing I noticed was the drive weight. Feels like a solid built piece of equipment.  Metal casing compared to plastic is very nice. Firmly  holds to my counter-top with 4 non-slip rubber buttons. The drive door opens smooth with the touch of a button.3.0 USB connections for power and read/write use. I connected to Windows 10 without any issues using Power DVD software to watch a movie and again flawless. The high point is noise, very little. All the noise is contained due to smooth operation of the drive and the solid build which absorbs most of noise.I haven't done any CD burns yet but I'm not worried about it because of the software I use and the initial performance was a good experience.UPDATE:  A good amount of usage on my part and now I can write to say, this is a very good buy. For the price I don't believe a better buy is out there.", b"I bought this cd/dvd drive and use it everyday. This works well with my small dell laptop and the  15'6 asus too. The design looks elegant and light weight. It have 3.0 usb port so the speed is fast. I try to install a software. There is no problem. The DVD run well. I think if it can read the Blu-ray then it will be perfect. The price is good with the high quality.", b"Update: May 31, 2018 - Seller read my review and contacted me; offered a replacement free of charge, which I have received. They knew in advance I could not return the defective unit as I put it in the garbage before they contacted me. They trusted me in good faith, so I agreed try a replacement. Very Good Customer service from this seller. The bottom of the replacement unit seams slightly different than the previous unit.  USB cord is easier to remove from the built in holder. It has a small yet functional finger dip to make removal of the cable easier and it does remove much easier. The bottom case holding the USB connector for storage also feels less snug but not floppy. THIS IS A GOOD CHANGE as it reduces the strain on the cable when you use it.  I do not use an external DVD/CD drive often. This unit is playing my media without issue. My previous issue was only with the quality of the connection between the USB cable and USB connector. The change to the bottom of the case may very well prevent the problem I had from reoccurring.  Currently it's playing my media without issue.  I'm changing my star rating from 1 to 4 due to the Great Customer service from seller and what I perceive as changes to bottom of the case.  I will update this review again if things go bad with the replacement unit. **** Original review******Device was delivered Dec 12, 2017, used about 5 times before it died 2 months after delivery. USB cord is garbage. The USB plug separated from outer wire covering and developed intermittent connection. Older iClever external USB 2.0 drive with metal case is still going strong years later. This model is junk.", b"So, I needed a burner as I had just purchased a new computer and it didn't have one. I really didn't think anything ofbitbupon purchading it ao when it came in and didn't have one I had 2 options send it back and order yet another one with a butner and wait for it to come in or order an external burner with 2day shipping and give it a shot. I opted for oprion B. This was super easy to use there was no programs to download or install simply plug and play. I plugged it in and ot is just like it's an original part of the computer.  I highly highly recommend this to everyone who doesn't have one it's so easy to use anyone can do it. It was completely compatible with my windows 10 and works like a charm. So, if you are on the fence about it jump down and grab this one it's absolutely awesome!!!", b'This external DVD drive works great. Easy to use. Good quality.

After fussing with it for at least 30 minutes, I put a disk in it even though nothing went as the instruction guide indicated and it worked like a charm. Have only used it once so will have to use it again to know how well it works. I gave it four stars because it worked well once I started using it.']}

He loves everything about it, the way it looks, it's not bulky (he can carry it to classes with no issues), ease of use and it performs everything he needs it to for class. I would definitely purchase again.", b"I was hesitant because of the Chrome interface, but now I'm completely sold.  Since it is a Chrome interface, no antivirus is needed!  It took me a while to understand this, but it's true.  I was concerned about being able to access my Windows programs, but with Windows 265 being online, and the fantastic Google Docs/Sheets, this is fully functional.  I bought this for web access while traveling, but now it's replacing my larger laptops.  Oh yeah, the battery really lasts with 8 hours of use unplugged documented so far.  The battery still had juice at the end of the day.", b"As easy to use as my previous Chromebook, no learning curve, with a lot more memory so I can write a lot more offline, saving data charges. I'm a professional writer living in an area that has wireless strength challenges, so memory is important.", b'Great bargain for a Chromebook to surf the web, Google Docs, etc... Love the size which makes it easy to put in backpack for traveling or just around town. The touch pad is super sensitive so I use a USB mouse 50% of the time. Could not find a way to turn off touchpad which is the only "con."This would be a perfect first laptop for young children.']}

I ordered the pink tumbler because she isn\'t the stainless steel type. I wanted to jazz it up a little and saw the idea for a decal, so to Amazon I came. Which decal to order was an easy decision due to all of the great reviews. The only thing I had to decide on was the details.I was unsure on color since the only examples I saw were in stainless steel tumblers. I ended up getting purple glitter and the two look great together.The next decision was size. For 5 letters I went with 1.5" and I think this was the right decision. I would not have wanted any bigger.Putting it in the tumbler was a breeze - just follow the instructions and take your time. If I ever need another decal, I will be back for sure.', b'Decal is exactly as they describe it.  No issues whatsoever.  Perfectly matched color to the amazon pic and font is awesome.

It tore easily when I was trying to stick it to the metal cup, but I could have been a little more careful.  Either that, or the sticker could have been a little stronger (I'd prefer the later, lol).", b'Great looking decals!!  Awesome service and shipping too.

However, if you open completely, they are quite thin and awkward to clean with. The plus side, of not opening completely, is that they fit back into the envelope well, and if you roll down the top tightly, I'v found they stay moist and I can get at least one more use out of them -- making them an exceptional value.", b'Not too moist, not too dry. Cleans eye glass lenses beautifully and cell phones as well. So much better than the ones we had been using from a national drug store chain.  Took a risk with a brand that I never heard of but with great reviews and very glad that I did. Thank you!', b'I have been struggling to find pre-moistened wipes for spectacles, which are neither too wet, or not moist enough. Some wipes, although adequately moist, seem to leave a streak on the lenses, which means having to dry off with a paper towel.

Just fabulous!', b"Smudges on my glasses are a constant, daily struggle for me. I can try my hardest to avoid touching my glasses all day, but my eyelashes and general dust from the environment end up making my glasses dirty after a few hours. As a result, I am forever in search of a product that will fix my constant smudge problem.This product promised to make my life easier and failed to deliver on that promise. Every time I use these, I'm left with smudgy glasses that seem dirtier than they were before. I wipe and wipe and wipe and it just creates more smudges. What a total waste of money.", b"These were a great deal, but I think they're better suited for screens rather than glasses. They're very, very moist, which has caused streaks and a film on my glasses several times. I'm going to buy different wipes for my glasses, but I love these for my electronic device screens as well as my TV screens.", b"I've tried every brand of lens wipes and this one by far is the best I've used.  They are larger than most wipes, have more moisture so they last longer - can be used on multiple items with one wipe - for instance, I cleaned both my glasses, my phone, my husband's phone and my tablet, and I do believe it would have lasted for a few more items had they been available.  They do not streak or leave a film - unlike some other brands.  I will definitely be buying this again!  (And no - I did not receive any payment or compensation for my review - I just think this is a great product!)", b'Before I purchased the lens cleaner wipes I read the reviews and they seem to be a bit negative about the lens cleaner wipes but for the price of the wipes it was a good idea to get some. I did and I am very pleased with the price and quality of the product. I will be ready to purchase these again.', b'Lots of wipes for a low price. The wipes are bigger than I expected so I sometimes use them for more than just glasses (what I originally bought this for). These wipes have more moisture than wipes made specifically for glasses, but these are intended for more uses. I think other uses may not work so well if these were not so moist.

I am not tech savvy enough to fix the problem and will be returning the product.', b"My laptop came with a hard disk SMART error and a few hot keys not working (microphone mute, screen brightness -, screen brightness +). Interestingly, the laptop came with an after-market sticker cover over the mousepad. I returned the laptop for a new one.The 2nd laptop did not have a smart error, but the same hot keys were not working and occasionally the touchpad mouse would go unresponsive (I could still use the joystick mouse). I updated the BIOS & drivers but the issues continued. The solution was to reboot the BIOS with UEFI (originally set to Legacy), revert to factory settings (with Windows 8 Pro) using a disk sent to me from hp support, at this point--update BIOS & drivers using a disk from hp support, then install Windows 10, then activate Windows 10 Pro. Now everything seems to be working fine. (Thank you HP support team for all the help!)Conclusion: Unless you are tech savvy, these small quirks will be a headache to straighten out. Now that it's working properly, I really enjoy it.

To start out, I\'m a software engineer working in the realm of cloud DevOps, and multi-platform web and mobile application development. As much of my time is spent writing code as building cloud infrastructure in AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.  As such, I can defer a lot of horse power to those cloud services and keep my actual computer fairly lean.  After playing with a loaner Chromebook for a couple of months, I found the whole minimalist approach Google has taken with this platform to be totally refreshing, this Chromebook kits that up a notch and then some.Going to break this down into three parts: Hardware/Design, Use as a Stock ChromeOS Device, and Advanced Usage... In each section, I\'ll summarize the pros/cons and then at the end will provide a final summary. Hope this helps you get a good idea of what this Chromebook is capable of and why it\'s such a great buy.1. Hardware & DesignAsus has really set a new standard with the C302CA\'s internals and physical design. Internally this device is basically an entry-level MacBook.  A 12.5" IPS screen that is gorgeous to look at, extremely bright and full 1080p resolution.  A solid little M3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of SSD storage make this machine capable of handling heavy usage and earn it a solid Octane 2.0 score in the 19000-20000 range. No slouch.The physical design is not just one of the best I\'ve seen in a Chromebook but also in the general "ultrabook" form factor with comparable quality and design details associated with MacBook Air, MacBook, Asus\' own Zen line, and Samsung\'s recent Chromebook Plus and Pro offerings.  The case is a solid aluminum billet structure with the now-ubiquitous scissor-action chicklet keyboard.  The surface texture of the case is a satiny paper-like touch, which is both clean and easy to wipe down, but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it. While Samsung has gone with an iPad-esque rounded edge style with their Chromebook Plus/Pro lines, Asus has stuck with a clean, square edge design with subtle beveling reminiscent of miniaturized MacBook Pro 13".  Even with the 2-in-1 flip hinge, the device has a solid feel and there\'s very little wobble in the screen while typing. The backlighting on the keyboard is a really nice treat and makes using the Chromebook in low-light settings a dream.When in the "flipped" form factor, you\'re effectively looking at a 12.5" Android Tablet experience.  The pop-up keyboard looks just like the Android screen keyboard and the orientation detection and capacitive touch screen are snappy and very responsive.  One place that does frustrate me in the tablet mode is that ChromeOS has a number of UI features that don\'t lend themselves to touch interaction.  For example, the "close-X" button on tabs is very tiny and has a small hit-target area on the screen.  Similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat-fingering.  A simple OS update to make tablet mode "beef-up" certain UI components would give this a much more Android-like table experience. More on Android in a bit...The touchpad on the C302CA is the best I\'ve used on a Chromebook to date. It has a glassy-smooth surface that resists finger-prints and goop, is very large, and has a firm but not too-clunky feeling click to it. It takes up more than 1/3rd of the palm-area horizontal space and makes thumb-tapping mouse tweaks very easy.  Likewise, the touch screen has a very nice responsiveness and I regularly find myself just deferring to the touchscreen for scrolling and quick button-clicks.Finally, there are the ports... and this is where I had the most trepidation about this machine. To keep the lean and skinny profile, Asus (like Apple) has equipped the C302CA with a whopping 2 USB-C ports (one on each side of the keyboard), a micro-SD expansion slot, and a headphone-mic jack.  The USB-C ports can act as the power-jack which is convenient when your power plug is sometimes on the left and sometimes on the right.  Unfortunately, if you\'re charging the machine, this leaves you with only one remaining USB-C port.  I\'ve purchased a multi-port hub that provides a pass-thru USB-C plug, 2 USB3.0-B plugs, and ethernet jack, and an HDMI-out port. I velcro it to the back of the screen and remove it when I\'m using the device in tablet mode (since I usually don\'t need it wired up in tablet mode).  It gets the job done, but running $50-100 for a good dongle like this, you\'re adding to the TCO of the device if you need more connectivity than a single USB-C port.The battery life on the C302CA is no joke, either. I\'ve been getting regular 10-11hr usage times between charges and it can get back to fully charged over the USB-C ports in about 2-3hrs.  Really in-and-of-itself that\'s a great feature by just reducing the need to always lug around a power-brick.Pros:- Internals are very performant and well-spec\'d for the entry-level price point of this Chromebook- The physical case is solid and of a production quality you\'d expect in machine 3-5x the price of this machine- Beautiful, bright IPS Screen with full 1080p resolution- User interfaces that are tight, responsive, and comparable to Apple grade quality- Backlit keyboard rocks- Battery life is pretty amazing at 10-11hrsCons:- 4Gb RAM cap... Rumor has it Asus will be releasing 8Gb and 16Gb variants down the road... this will be a good thing for power-users- Many UI elements are not user-friendly in tablet mode- Port minimalism... two USB-C\'s pretty much guarantees your going to be investing in a could adaptor/hubs to carry around wtih you2. Stock ChromeOS UsageOut of the box, the Asus C302CA is a powerhouse for stock ChromeOS usage.  The general mantra of ChromeOS is that the web/cloud is your primary application interface and stand-alone applications are really just web-applications bundled up as Chrome browser Apps/extensions. Initially, this may seem like a limiting scope for being able to get actual work done beyond just web-surfing.  But with a host of solid productivity suites on the web these days (Google Mail/Docs/Drive/Calendar, MS Office365, and Apple iCloud Apps), you can actually do a major amount of your day-to-day productivity activities with a Chromebook w/ having to install a single copy of anything to do it.For more advanced usages, there are now a number of cloud-based development toolkits and graphics tools available to make a stock ChromeOS system a capable web development environment. I have a stack setup right now with GitHub for source control, Cloud9 for development environment/terminal access, and a couple of AWS services for code assembly and deployment to a dev cloud server.  All and all, it\'s a light weight, but very robust development stack, that also has the added convenience of Cloud9\'s collaboration features wherein multiple developers can be writing code in even the same file simultaneously.  Much like collaborative editing in Google Docs/Spreadsheets, but in code itself.  Great for pair programming, code reviews and group refactoring sessions.Performance-wise, I can easily have 12-24 tabs open simultaneously and see no slow-down in performance.  On occasion a tab may freeze up on me with the "Uh-oh!" message, but this is no more regular than what I\'ve experienced with the Chrome browser on Mac, Linux and Windows systems.  I\'ve fiddled with some web-based games, but the graphics capabilities while decent for this form factor, you won\'t be playing any intense games in stock ChromeOS mode.Where ChromeOS really shines and what I think is going to be a very significant deal-maker for these devices in the coming year is the inclusion of the Google Play Store and the ability to run Android applications in the ChromeOS environment.  You do have to be on the developer channel of the OS to get this feature, but there are a number of guides in the ether that explain how to set it up.  As the owner of an Android phone, I really like this feature since I can load apps onto the Chromebook that I regularly use already, apps I\'ve paid for are available on this device, and the Play Store accurately recognizes the C302CA as a "tablet" form factor and will suggest the tablet alternative of many apps.  Thus far, I\'ve loaded a number of games, my password vault, several productivity apps, Skype, Spotify and some network scanning Android Apps and they\'ve all worked very well.  On occasion with graphically intensive apps, like games, there can be some masking artifacts around graphics and sprites that can easily be fixed usually just by restarting the app.  I\'m really looking forward to where Google takes this in the coming years as it looks like they\'re trying to find the ideal balance between ChromeOS and Android... An AndroidOS, if you will.One place that I find lacking in ChromeOS is the settings management.  For the most-part you don\'t have much freedom to make any significant changes to settings.  Mouse and Trackpad settings are very minimalist, there\'s no way to modify short-cut keys, and the power management options are pretty minimal, too. All and all, they are simple devices, but it would be nice to have a more immediate access to deep config settings.One of the features of ChromeOS that I find very convenient is the way in which all of your configuration settings are stored in the cloud with your gmail account.  When I grab my daughter\'s Acer R11 or borrow a coworker\'s Chromebook, all I need do is login with my Google account and within seconds I\'ve got the same user experience I get anywhere else in the GoogSpace...Pros:- Clean and secure operating system that is very lean and gets the most out of the systems modest specs- With the combination of web-based productivity tools and development apps/services, this Chromebook can provide a breadth of very viable usage scenarios without bogging the system down with locally install applications.- Android Apps and Google Play Store are real game changers for the ChromeOS landscape... Suddenly, one device can effectively serve as a platform for two different application topologies.  And the Google Play Store is chock-full of great apps and games.- Boot time, sleep time and wake time are crazy fast... There\'s never a long, finger-tapping wait for the system to come up.Cons:- System settings could be more robust and better organized- Tablet-mode still needs some work... It\'s definitely a work in progress, but with more 2-in-1\'s entering the market, I\'m expecting there will be significant feature enhancements around tablet-mode.3. Advanced Usage[WARNING: Here there be dragons!!! The following options require you setting up your Chromebook in "Developer Mode" which requires a full factory-reset.  This in-turn provides features that are normally disabled in "Normal" ChromeOS mode.  Venture at your own risk/responsibility...]So, this is where this little Chromebook REALLY shines... As I mentioned in the intro, I\'m a software engineer and while I love the liberation and simplicity of the ChromeOS experience, there are still times where I want some more classic applications like you\'d find on MacOS, Linux, or Windows.  Luckily, there are a number of ways to accomplish this and there\'s a healthy developer community regularly making new tools and options.  Since ChromeOS is itself a Linux platform that\'s been pared down to a very simple and low-overhead system footprint.  This gives us several ways to get a more fully-featured desktop experience:a) Chroot/Crouton Linux Desktop Installationb) Chroot/Crouton/Xiwi Embedded Application Launcherc) Dual Booting into Linux DesktopThe first two options are very similar and only differ in the way in which you interact with the Linux environment, while the third option is quite literally installing a full installation of Linux onto the machine and booting directly into it instead of ChromeOS.  Without going into too much detail (seriously, google or wikipedia \'chroot\' if you want the bloody details), a "chroot" is a parallel installation of an operating system in it\'s own isolated "container" in the ChromeOS operating system. It\'s neat because it let\'s you run both ChromeOS -and- a Linux Desktop OS like Ubuntu at the same time (!!!). The chroot installation is actually sharing number of resources with the ChromeOS operating system, making it still very resource conservative.Crouton is an opensource script that makes the creation, installation and management of one or >many< chroot installations a breeze. With the Crouton script and a decent internet connection, you can very easily have Ubuntu or one of it\'s many variants installed in about 10 minutes.  Once installed, you just need to press Ctrl-Alt-Shift-FwdArrow and you\'ll be in a running Linux desktop... -BackArrow to hop back over to ChromeOS.  It\'s really seamless and smooth to move back and forth and makes experimenting with different Linux configs and environments effortless.In addition to this first full-desktop chroot approach, Crouton offers another installation method that lets you run Linux in a "headless" mode where there is no desktop environment, rather the Linux OS forwards the application windows to the ChromeOS desktop.  This is accomplished by installing the "xiwi" packages into the Linux chroot and adding a ChromeOS extension that exposes the ChromeOS desktop interface to the Linux chroot.  When all is said and done, you can setup an application launcher which will bootstrap and app on the Linux chroot and then open it in a window on the ChromeOS desktop.  Iv\'e used this method to install VS Code, Arduino IDE, and a 3D printer host application in this "embedded mode" and it\'s very functional and comfortable  to have everything in the ChromeOS experience and just consume the resources needed to run the application and nothing else.  It\'s worth noting that there is a performance hit with this approach, namely that the forwarding of the application window to ChromeOS comes at the cost of losing accelerated graphics rendering for the Linux apps.  While I can run Minecraft in a full-desktop chroot of Xubuntu with a very good framerate and rendering, when I use the xiwi approach here, the game is nearly unplayable.  That being said, for code editors, general productivity and networking apps, and just a basic XTerm, this approach works just fine.Finally, there\'s the most performant but also most disconnected from ChromeOS approach of installing a full Linux OS in a separate partition on the machine\'s system drive or microSD drive.  I\'ve done this using the excellent GalliumOS which is an upstart opensource distribution based on Xubuntu that pares down the OS footprint, adds appropriate graphics drivers and memory management configurations that make it zippy on a small system like this one, AND adds a number of touch, keyboard, and 2-in-1 friendly features. This installation has a lot of pep in it... Apps start very fast, graphics are much more responsive and capable when not being shared with ChromeOS and there are a number of ways you can tweak the UI/UX to your own liking.  I haven\'t tried it yet, but there are reports that Steam-based games can be run on this sort of configuration, but with a limited number of hardware applicable games.  Again, this isn\'t going to be a gaming mega-machine.  You also sacrifice not having access to the Android/Play Store features.  But if you\'re looking to run an app that needs all the resources, like Gimp or a Java IDE, then this is the way to go.  Having a zippy 128GB microSD card to mount for system storage on the Linux side is convenient too because you can also mount it from a chroot Linus installation on the ChromeOS side so you can share files and config across the various installation types.If only for the dual boot option, I\'m actually looking forward to when Asus actually releases the 8GB and 16GB models as I\'d actually consider that to be a worthwhile since it would open the possibility of hypervisor\'ing virtualbox and docker containers with serious resource availability.  All that being said, you get a lot of bang for the buck with these three enhanced desktop/application options and I use all three in some capacity every day, so don\'t think your\'e isolated to just one approach.4. SummaryIn conclusion, the Asus C302CA Flip Chromebook is hands-down one of the best new offerings for Chromebooks in 2017 up there with the Samsung Plus/Pro models, and some of the new HP models.  Build quality is amazing and not just a plastic, toy-like assembly, but a solid unit with high-quality parts through-and-through.  As a stand-alone, stock ChromeOS device, the C302CA performs as well as Chromebooks in the $800-$1000 price range and provides more than enough options as just a web-application and Android app platform. If you really want to get the most out of this little wonder, then the options for installing Linux OS in various forms and integrations is solid and has outstanding opensource and community support in GitHub, reddit and Google Groups. When adding that "secret sauce" this machine goes from being a basic ChromeOS device to a fully-featured development platform... for only about $450-$500.  By comparison, the entry level Apple MacBook has the same CPU, same graphics chip, comes with 8Gb more RAM, a 256Gb SSD, but a lower-resolution screen, and no touch or 2-in-1 features... for $1300.  You won\'t be disappointed with this great little machine how ever you end up using it, and that versatility is what really makes this machine such a fun and valuable computer.I\'d also recommend that you consider the following items for accessorizing your C302CA:a) Vinyl Skins - There are a vast number of very beautiful skins available for this model that provide protection for the screen cover, keyboard face/palm rest, and screen bezel.  While the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough, it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it.b) Anti-glare Screen Protector -  The glossy glass screen cover is beautiful, but it has two drawbacks: it\'s a mess of a fingerprint magnet and it\'s so glossy that in outdoor environments or spaces with a lot of stray light from windows, the screen becomes a glare-reflecting mess.  For ~$15 you can get a nice, fitted anti-glare screen protector that reduces the fingerprint/glare problems AND gives you some piece of mind about protecting that gorgeous screen.c) USB-C Expansion Dongle - There are a number of them out there to address this port-minimalism trend.  If you want to use a mouse/keyboard with a USB-A style wireless dongle, plugin an external HDD, display to an external monitor, or use an ethernet hardline, you\'re going to need one of these.  Expect to pay $50-$125 depending of features a build quality.  Don\'t skimp on USB-C devices, they handle a ton of current and you don\'t want a cheap hub toasting your USB bus.d) A Bluetooth Mouse - While this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in Chromebook Land, there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse... ChromeOS supports Bluetooth 4.0 and LE devices and there are a lot of nice, slim-style mice out there similar to Apple\'s Magic Mouse that are BT and don\'t require a USB dongle.e) 64GB/128GB/256GB microSD Card - The only way to expand this machines internal storage is through a microSD card.  You could conceivably  install a USB 3.0 type-A low-profile memory stick on a USB-C adaptor, but that would be silly.  With many of the high-performance microSD cards getting to 90-100mb/s read-write speeds, these drives can be used for all sorts of things, like storing music, videos, photos and the likes on a shared device.f) A Capacitive Touch Pen - I prefer the kind that are active tip charging so that you can have a very fine-point, but still register contact.  Helps with dealing with miniscule UI elements when in tablet mode.Hope this has helped you make a decision and happy computing!', b'Much has been written already in reviews, so I\'ll stick to two things: comparing it to the previous Asus Flip c100, and using a stylus with it (something people thinking about the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro would be interested in).c100 Comparison:I\'ve had this for only a couple days. It seems pretty fast. A lot faster than the c100. It\'s much smoother with web pages and android apps, and the touch screen is more responsive. It\'s still not quiiite as buttery smooth as a macbook pro (it\'s also only 20-30% of the price, which is crazy). For example, scrolling in a PDF is fast but not super super smooth. The build quality is a bit better than the c100. There\'s not as much flex, it\'s a bit more premium feeling. The finish is very very similar. Keyboard is a bit nicer, not tons. So yes, the build quality is way better than the majority of (plastic) chromebooks out there, but not way better than the c100 (because that\'s already pretty nice). As many have said, it approaches macbook pro build quality (and looks). Screen is slightly brighter than the c100 (not a lot), and slightly better (sharper). The difference is discernible, but certainly not a big difference. Again, a much much better screen than the TN screens on many chromebooks, ..but the c100 screen is also much better than those.It\'s significantly larger and heavier than the c100. One of the things I like best about the c100 is how ultraportable it is. Sometimes I forget it\'s in my bag. The c302 is a significantly bigger laptop. Feels like a 13" to me, coming from such a small one. Bezels are much smaller on the c302, except the bottom one, ...but they\'re not thin bezels. I\'ve included a bunch of comparison photos. Nearly identical thickness, although the c302 *feels* thicker/more substantial.Stylus:I ordered the Meko 2-pack, 2-type stylus (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E0LHE26). The c302\'s competitor, the Samsung Chromebook Pro, comes with a stylus. I went with the Asus c302 over the Samsung Pro because I was a bit concerned with the Pro\'s quality issues and the shorter battery life, ..and to a lesser extent the lack of backlit keyboard. But I did want to use a stylus occasionally for note taking/sketching. Maybe annotating pdf\'s. I had read in the comments of another review that the pointy/disc stylus type didnt really work with it. For me it *does*. In my experience with the apps I\'ve tried so far (Keep android app, Kami PDF web app, and Sketchbook android app) *both* the point/disc stylus tip and the rounded metallic knob tip types work really well. If I\'m writing quickly, there\'s a very slight lag before things appear, but nothing that will annoy me at all. One Note android app registered well and smoothly, but was more laggy. The way I see it, the main thing you\'re missing is the palm rejection that you get with the Pro (because it has a pen digitizer in the screen). For casual use, this will work fine for me.(fyi - all the styluses I\'ve tried with the c100 [including this Meko, either tip] have been miserable and useless.) So I\'m very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302.Final, initial thoughts: For me, the computer is a bit bigger than I would like. Ideally, it would be a 11.5-12" (not 12.5") screen with minimal bezels, which would make it almost as small as the c100. The default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me. Holding it in tablet mode is awkard given it\'s size and weight - more so than the c100. However, most of the time if I want horizontal tablet mode I\'ll use the "stand" mode (keyboard face down in my lap, screen angled up). Portrait tablet mode works better than expected because it\'s thin, has a magnetic closure, and has a large side bezel. I\'ll try to update this in the coming days and weeks as I use this more. Feel free to ask questions. Overall I\'m very happy so far ..just very stingy with my 5-star ratings. I might change it to a 5-star in the coming days.']}

I got this for my office desk.  Very convenient. Worthy the price", b'Great output and fairly quite for how powerful it is. These little fans are absolute life savers on hot days and you\'ll wonder why you didn\'t own one sooner. Out of the 3 Portable fans I just purchased at the same time (all different) this is the best of the 3.  The 18650 battery included claims it\'s 2200mah and took a charge just fine.  It\'s actually a better quality battery than I expected but using a higher quality and capacity battery like a 3500mah MXJO would dramatically increase the battery life obviously.  I would also recommend using an external charger like this one I have\xc2\xa0Nitecore D2 Charger with LCD Display Universal Smart Charger For Rechargeable Batteries IMR/Li-ion/LiFePO4/Ni-MH/Ni-Cd\xc2\xa0though if you don\'t have one the built in charger does work but it\'s always a good idea to use a dedicated charger on devices like this.I like the LED function (the LEDs that actually illuminate the fan blades not the external LED) a bit better than the other portable fans I have because they are shielded and don\'t "leak" light everywhere like other models.  So it\'s just a bit more pleasant than other fans LEDs and the external LED works fine but my only complaint is the fact you can only use the LED on the side when the fan itself is off.  It goes - Low - Medium - High - LED and you hold down the On button for 4 seconds to turn on the LEDs that light the fan blades.I\'m not sure why I did such an in-depth review of this silly little fan but there it is.  Would purchase again.', b"I LOVE this fan. it's pretty small and fits almost anywhere. My laptop sits on a venting board with some extra USB connectors. I use one of these extra connectors to plug in the fan. It only has 1 speed but it's perfect when you need a little extra airflow and turning up the AC in a room/office isn't an option. While there is a bit of hum from the air, the motor is pretty quiet and certainly not a bother to me. it feels pretty solid and I expect it be around for many years. Friends who have stopped in my office and saw it like it and have purchased one, too.", b"I've only been using this fan for a few days but I have to say 'so far' it's perfect. I work in an office off a truck shop and, in order to keep the smell of oil and such out of the desk area, we close our office door regularly.  This little fan does a great job of circulating the air in my corner of the room.  I'm considering buying another one to take along to concerts or other gatherings."]}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

To start out, I\'m a software engineer working in the realm of cloud DevOps, and multi-platform web and mobile application development. As much of my time is spent writing code as building cloud infrastructure in AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.  As such, I can defer a lot of horse power to those cloud services and keep my actual computer fairly lean.  After playing with a loaner Chromebook for a couple of months, I found the whole minimalist approach Google has taken with this platform to be totally refreshing, this Chromebook kits that up a notch and then some.Going to break this down into three parts: Hardware/Design, Use as a Stock ChromeOS Device, and Advanced Usage... In each section, I\'ll summarize the pros/cons and then at the end will provide a final summary. Hope this helps you get a good idea of what this Chromebook is capable of and why it\'s such a great buy.1. Hardware & DesignAsus has really set a new standard with the C302CA\'s internals and physical design. Internally this device is basically an entry-level MacBook.  A 12.5" IPS screen that is gorgeous to look at, extremely bright and full 1080p resolution.  A solid little M3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of SSD storage make this machine capable of handling heavy usage and earn it a solid Octane 2.0 score in the 19000-20000 range. No slouch.The physical design is not just one of the best I\'ve seen in a Chromebook but also in the general "ultrabook" form factor with comparable quality and design details associated with MacBook Air, MacBook, Asus\' own Zen line, and Samsung\'s recent Chromebook Plus and Pro offerings.  The case is a solid aluminum billet structure with the now-ubiquitous scissor-action chicklet keyboard.  The surface texture of the case is a satiny paper-like touch, which is both clean and easy to wipe down, but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it. While Samsung has gone with an iPad-esque rounded edge style with their Chromebook Plus/Pro lines, Asus has stuck with a clean, square edge design with subtle beveling reminiscent of miniaturized MacBook Pro 13".  Even with the 2-in-1 flip hinge, the device has a solid feel and there\'s very little wobble in the screen while typing. The backlighting on the keyboard is a really nice treat and makes using the Chromebook in low-light settings a dream.When in the "flipped" form factor, you\'re effectively looking at a 12.5" Android Tablet experience.  The pop-up keyboard looks just like the Android screen keyboard and the orientation detection and capacitive touch screen are snappy and very responsive.  One place that does frustrate me in the tablet mode is that ChromeOS has a number of UI features that don\'t lend themselves to touch interaction.  For example, the "close-X" button on tabs is very tiny and has a small hit-target area on the screen.  Similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat-fingering.  A simple OS update to make tablet mode "beef-up" certain UI components would give this a much more Android-like table experience. More on Android in a bit...The touchpad on the C302CA is the best I\'ve used on a Chromebook to date. It has a glassy-smooth surface that resists finger-prints and goop, is very large, and has a firm but not too-clunky feeling click to it. It takes up more than 1/3rd of the palm-area horizontal space and makes thumb-tapping mouse tweaks very easy.  Likewise, the touch screen has a very nice responsiveness and I regularly find myself just deferring to the touchscreen for scrolling and quick button-clicks.Finally, there are the ports... and this is where I had the most trepidation about this machine. To keep the lean and skinny profile, Asus (like Apple) has equipped the C302CA with a whopping 2 USB-C ports (one on each side of the keyboard), a micro-SD expansion slot, and a headphone-mic jack.  The USB-C ports can act as the power-jack which is convenient when your power plug is sometimes on the left and sometimes on the right.  Unfortunately, if you\'re charging the machine, this leaves you with only one remaining USB-C port.  I\'ve purchased a multi-port hub that provides a pass-thru USB-C plug, 2 USB3.0-B plugs, and ethernet jack, and an HDMI-out port. I velcro it to the back of the screen and remove it when I\'m using the device in tablet mode (since I usually don\'t need it wired up in tablet mode).  It gets the job done, but running $50-100 for a good dongle like this, you\'re adding to the TCO of the device if you need more connectivity than a single USB-C port.The battery life on the C302CA is no joke, either. I\'ve been getting regular 10-11hr usage times between charges and it can get back to fully charged over the USB-C ports in about 2-3hrs.  Really in-and-of-itself that\'s a great feature by just reducing the need to always lug around a power-brick.Pros:- Internals are very performant and well-spec\'d for the entry-level price point of this Chromebook- The physical case is solid and of a production quality you\'d expect in machine 3-5x the price of this machine- Beautiful, bright IPS Screen with full 1080p resolution- User interfaces that are tight, responsive, and comparable to Apple grade quality- Backlit keyboard rocks- Battery life is pretty amazing at 10-11hrsCons:- 4Gb RAM cap... Rumor has it Asus will be releasing 8Gb and 16Gb variants down the road... this will be a good thing for power-users- Many UI elements are not user-friendly in tablet mode- Port minimalism... two USB-C\'s pretty much guarantees your going to be investing in a could adaptor/hubs to carry around wtih you2. Stock ChromeOS UsageOut of the box, the Asus C302CA is a powerhouse for stock ChromeOS usage.  The general mantra of ChromeOS is that the web/cloud is your primary application interface and stand-alone applications are really just web-applications bundled up as Chrome browser Apps/extensions. Initially, this may seem like a limiting scope for being able to get actual work done beyond just web-surfing.  But with a host of solid productivity suites on the web these days (Google Mail/Docs/Drive/Calendar, MS Office365, and Apple iCloud Apps), you can actually do a major amount of your day-to-day productivity activities with a Chromebook w/ having to install a single copy of anything to do it.For more advanced usages, there are now a number of cloud-based development toolkits and graphics tools available to make a stock ChromeOS system a capable web development environment. I have a stack setup right now with GitHub for source control, Cloud9 for development environment/terminal access, and a couple of AWS services for code assembly and deployment to a dev cloud server.  All and all, it\'s a light weight, but very robust development stack, that also has the added convenience of Cloud9\'s collaboration features wherein multiple developers can be writing code in even the same file simultaneously.  Much like collaborative editing in Google Docs/Spreadsheets, but in code itself.  Great for pair programming, code reviews and group refactoring sessions.Performance-wise, I can easily have 12-24 tabs open simultaneously and see no slow-down in performance.  On occasion a tab may freeze up on me with the "Uh-oh!" message, but this is no more regular than what I\'ve experienced with the Chrome browser on Mac, Linux and Windows systems.  I\'ve fiddled with some web-based games, but the graphics capabilities while decent for this form factor, you won\'t be playing any intense games in stock ChromeOS mode.Where ChromeOS really shines and what I think is going to be a very significant deal-maker for these devices in the coming year is the inclusion of the Google Play Store and the ability to run Android applications in the ChromeOS environment.  You do have to be on the developer channel of the OS to get this feature, but there are a number of guides in the ether that explain how to set it up.  As the owner of an Android phone, I really like this feature since I can load apps onto the Chromebook that I regularly use already, apps I\'ve paid for are available on this device, and the Play Store accurately recognizes the C302CA as a "tablet" form factor and will suggest the tablet alternative of many apps.  Thus far, I\'ve loaded a number of games, my password vault, several productivity apps, Skype, Spotify and some network scanning Android Apps and they\'ve all worked very well.  On occasion with graphically intensive apps, like games, there can be some masking artifacts around graphics and sprites that can easily be fixed usually just by restarting the app.  I\'m really looking forward to where Google takes this in the coming years as it looks like they\'re trying to find the ideal balance between ChromeOS and Android... An AndroidOS, if you will.One place that I find lacking in ChromeOS is the settings management.  For the most-part you don\'t have much freedom to make any significant changes to settings.  Mouse and Trackpad settings are very minimalist, there\'s no way to modify short-cut keys, and the power management options are pretty minimal, too. All and all, they are simple devices, but it would be nice to have a more immediate access to deep config settings.One of the features of ChromeOS that I find very convenient is the way in which all of your configuration settings are stored in the cloud with your gmail account.  When I grab my daughter\'s Acer R11 or borrow a coworker\'s Chromebook, all I need do is login with my Google account and within seconds I\'ve got the same user experience I get anywhere else in the GoogSpace...Pros:- Clean and secure operating system that is very lean and gets the most out of the systems modest specs- With the combination of web-based productivity tools and development apps/services, this Chromebook can provide a breadth of very viable usage scenarios without bogging the system down with locally install applications.- Android Apps and Google Play Store are real game changers for the ChromeOS landscape... Suddenly, one device can effectively serve as a platform for two different application topologies.  And the Google Play Store is chock-full of great apps and games.- Boot time, sleep time and wake time are crazy fast... There\'s never a long, finger-tapping wait for the system to come up.Cons:- System settings could be more robust and better organized- Tablet-mode still needs some work... It\'s definitely a work in progress, but with more 2-in-1\'s entering the market, I\'m expecting there will be significant feature enhancements around tablet-mode.3. Advanced Usage[WARNING: Here there be dragons!!! The following options require you setting up your Chromebook in "Developer Mode" which requires a full factory-reset.  This in-turn provides features that are normally disabled in "Normal" ChromeOS mode.  Venture at your own risk/responsibility...]So, this is where this little Chromebook REALLY shines... As I mentioned in the intro, I\'m a software engineer and while I love the liberation and simplicity of the ChromeOS experience, there are still times where I want some more classic applications like you\'d find on MacOS, Linux, or Windows.  Luckily, there are a number of ways to accomplish this and there\'s a healthy developer community regularly making new tools and options.  Since ChromeOS is itself a Linux platform that\'s been pared down to a very simple and low-overhead system footprint.  This gives us several ways to get a more fully-featured desktop experience:a) Chroot/Crouton Linux Desktop Installationb) Chroot/Crouton/Xiwi Embedded Application Launcherc) Dual Booting into Linux DesktopThe first two options are very similar and only differ in the way in which you interact with the Linux environment, while the third option is quite literally installing a full installation of Linux onto the machine and booting directly into it instead of ChromeOS.  Without going into too much detail (seriously, google or wikipedia \'chroot\' if you want the bloody details), a "chroot" is a parallel installation of an operating system in it\'s own isolated "container" in the ChromeOS operating system. It\'s neat because it let\'s you run both ChromeOS -and- a Linux Desktop OS like Ubuntu at the same time (!!!). The chroot installation is actually sharing number of resources with the ChromeOS operating system, making it still very resource conservative.Crouton is an opensource script that makes the creation, installation and management of one or >many< chroot installations a breeze. With the Crouton script and a decent internet connection, you can very easily have Ubuntu or one of it\'s many variants installed in about 10 minutes.  Once installed, you just need to press Ctrl-Alt-Shift-FwdArrow and you\'ll be in a running Linux desktop... -BackArrow to hop back over to ChromeOS.  It\'s really seamless and smooth to move back and forth and makes experimenting with different Linux configs and environments effortless.In addition to this first full-desktop chroot approach, Crouton offers another installation method that lets you run Linux in a "headless" mode where there is no desktop environment, rather the Linux OS forwards the application windows to the ChromeOS desktop.  This is accomplished by installing the "xiwi" packages into the Linux chroot and adding a ChromeOS extension that exposes the ChromeOS desktop interface to the Linux chroot.  When all is said and done, you can setup an application launcher which will bootstrap and app on the Linux chroot and then open it in a window on the ChromeOS desktop.  Iv\'e used this method to install VS Code, Arduino IDE, and a 3D printer host application in this "embedded mode" and it\'s very functional and comfortable  to have everything in the ChromeOS experience and just consume the resources needed to run the application and nothing else.  It\'s worth noting that there is a performance hit with this approach, namely that the forwarding of the application window to ChromeOS comes at the cost of losing accelerated graphics rendering for the Linux apps.  While I can run Minecraft in a full-desktop chroot of Xubuntu with a very good framerate and rendering, when I use the xiwi approach here, the game is nearly unplayable.  That being said, for code editors, general productivity and networking apps, and just a basic XTerm, this approach works just fine.Finally, there\'s the most performant but also most disconnected from ChromeOS approach of installing a full Linux OS in a separate partition on the machine\'s system drive or microSD drive.  I\'ve done this using the excellent GalliumOS which is an upstart opensource distribution based on Xubuntu that pares down the OS footprint, adds appropriate graphics drivers and memory management configurations that make it zippy on a small system like this one, AND adds a number of touch, keyboard, and 2-in-1 friendly features. This installation has a lot of pep in it... Apps start very fast, graphics are much more responsive and capable when not being shared with ChromeOS and there are a number of ways you can tweak the UI/UX to your own liking.  I haven\'t tried it yet, but there are reports that Steam-based games can be run on this sort of configuration, but with a limited number of hardware applicable games.  Again, this isn\'t going to be a gaming mega-machine.  You also sacrifice not having access to the Android/Play Store features.  But if you\'re looking to run an app that needs all the resources, like Gimp or a Java IDE, then this is the way to go.  Having a zippy 128GB microSD card to mount for system storage on the Linux side is convenient too because you can also mount it from a chroot Linus installation on the ChromeOS side so you can share files and config across the various installation types.If only for the dual boot option, I\'m actually looking forward to when Asus actually releases the 8GB and 16GB models as I\'d actually consider that to be a worthwhile since it would open the possibility of hypervisor\'ing virtualbox and docker containers with serious resource availability.  All that being said, you get a lot of bang for the buck with these three enhanced desktop/application options and I use all three in some capacity every day, so don\'t think your\'e isolated to just one approach.4. SummaryIn conclusion, the Asus C302CA Flip Chromebook is hands-down one of the best new offerings for Chromebooks in 2017 up there with the Samsung Plus/Pro models, and some of the new HP models.  Build quality is amazing and not just a plastic, toy-like assembly, but a solid unit with high-quality parts through-and-through.  As a stand-alone, stock ChromeOS device, the C302CA performs as well as Chromebooks in the $800-$1000 price range and provides more than enough options as just a web-application and Android app platform. If you really want to get the most out of this little wonder, then the options for installing Linux OS in various forms and integrations is solid and has outstanding opensource and community support in GitHub, reddit and Google Groups. When adding that "secret sauce" this machine goes from being a basic ChromeOS device to a fully-featured development platform... for only about $450-$500.  By comparison, the entry level Apple MacBook has the same CPU, same graphics chip, comes with 8Gb more RAM, a 256Gb SSD, but a lower-resolution screen, and no touch or 2-in-1 features... for $1300.  You won\'t be disappointed with this great little machine how ever you end up using it, and that versatility is what really makes this machine such a fun and valuable computer.I\'d also recommend that you consider the following items for accessorizing your C302CA:a) Vinyl Skins - There are a vast number of very beautiful skins available for this model that provide protection for the screen cover, keyboard face/palm rest, and screen bezel.  While the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough, it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it.b) Anti-glare Screen Protector -  The glossy glass screen cover is beautiful, but it has two drawbacks: it\'s a mess of a fingerprint magnet and it\'s so glossy that in outdoor environments or spaces with a lot of stray light from windows, the screen becomes a glare-reflecting mess.  For ~$15 you can get a nice, fitted anti-glare screen protector that reduces the fingerprint/glare problems AND gives you some piece of mind about protecting that gorgeous screen.c) USB-C Expansion Dongle - There are a number of them out there to address this port-minimalism trend.  If you want to use a mouse/keyboard with a USB-A style wireless dongle, plugin an external HDD, display to an external monitor, or use an ethernet hardline, you\'re going to need one of these.  Expect to pay $50-$125 depending of features a build quality.  Don\'t skimp on USB-C devices, they handle a ton of current and you don\'t want a cheap hub toasting your USB bus.d) A Bluetooth Mouse - While this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in Chromebook Land, there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse... ChromeOS supports Bluetooth 4.0 and LE devices and there are a lot of nice, slim-style mice out there similar to Apple\'s Magic Mouse that are BT and don\'t require a USB dongle.e) 64GB/128GB/256GB microSD Card - The only way to expand this machines internal storage is through a microSD card.  You could conceivably  install a USB 3.0 type-A low-profile memory stick on a USB-C adaptor, but that would be silly.  With many of the high-performance microSD cards getting to 90-100mb/s read-write speeds, these drives can be used for all sorts of things, like storing music, videos, photos and the likes on a shared device.f) A Capacitive Touch Pen - I prefer the kind that are active tip charging so that you can have a very fine-point, but still register contact.  Helps with dealing with miniscule UI elements when in tablet mode.Hope this has helped you make a decision and happy computing!', b'Much has been written already in reviews, so I\'ll stick to two things: comparing it to the previous Asus Flip c100, and using a stylus with it (something people thinking about the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro would be interested in).c100 Comparison:I\'ve had this for only a couple days. It seems pretty fast. A lot faster than the c100. It\'s much smoother with web pages and android apps, and the touch screen is more responsive. It\'s still not quiiite as buttery smooth as a macbook pro (it\'s also only 20-30% of the price, which is crazy). For example, scrolling in a PDF is fast but not super super smooth. The build quality is a bit better than the c100. There\'s not as much flex, it\'s a bit more premium feeling. The finish is very very similar. Keyboard is a bit nicer, not tons. So yes, the build quality is way better than the majority of (plastic) chromebooks out there, but not way better than the c100 (because that\'s already pretty nice). As many have said, it approaches macbook pro build quality (and looks). Screen is slightly brighter than the c100 (not a lot), and slightly better (sharper). The difference is discernible, but certainly not a big difference. Again, a much much better screen than the TN screens on many chromebooks, ..but the c100 screen is also much better than those.It\'s significantly larger and heavier than the c100. One of the things I like best about the c100 is how ultraportable it is. Sometimes I forget it\'s in my bag. The c302 is a significantly bigger laptop. Feels like a 13" to me, coming from such a small one. Bezels are much smaller on the c302, except the bottom one, ...but they\'re not thin bezels. I\'ve included a bunch of comparison photos. Nearly identical thickness, although the c302 *feels* thicker/more substantial.Stylus:I ordered the Meko 2-pack, 2-type stylus (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E0LHE26). The c302\'s competitor, the Samsung Chromebook Pro, comes with a stylus. I went with the Asus c302 over the Samsung Pro because I was a bit concerned with the Pro\'s quality issues and the shorter battery life, ..and to a lesser extent the lack of backlit keyboard. But I did want to use a stylus occasionally for note taking/sketching. Maybe annotating pdf\'s. I had read in the comments of another review that the pointy/disc stylus type didnt really work with it. For me it *does*. In my experience with the apps I\'ve tried so far (Keep android app, Kami PDF web app, and Sketchbook android app) *both* the point/disc stylus tip and the rounded metallic knob tip types work really well. If I\'m writing quickly, there\'s a very slight lag before things appear, but nothing that will annoy me at all. One Note android app registered well and smoothly, but was more laggy. The way I see it, the main thing you\'re missing is the palm rejection that you get with the Pro (because it has a pen digitizer in the screen). For casual use, this will work fine for me.(fyi - all the styluses I\'ve tried with the c100 [including this Meko, either tip] have been miserable and useless.) So I\'m very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302.Final, initial thoughts: For me, the computer is a bit bigger than I would like. Ideally, it would be a 11.5-12" (not 12.5") screen with minimal bezels, which would make it almost as small as the c100. The default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me. Holding it in tablet mode is awkard given it\'s size and weight - more so than the c100. However, most of the time if I want horizontal tablet mode I\'ll use the "stand" mode (keyboard face down in my lap, screen angled up). Portrait tablet mode works better than expected because it\'s thin, has a magnetic closure, and has a large side bezel. I\'ll try to update this in the coming days and weeks as I use this more. Feel free to ask questions. Overall I\'m very happy so far ..just very stingy with my 5-star ratings. I might change it to a 5-star in the coming days.']}

These little fans are absolute life savers on hot days and you\'ll wonder why you didn\'t own one sooner. Out of the 3 Portable fans I just purchased at the same time (all different) this is the best of the 3.  The 18650 battery included claims it\'s 2200mah and took a charge just fine.  It\'s actually a better quality battery than I expected but using a higher quality and capacity battery like a 3500mah MXJO would dramatically increase the battery life obviously.  I would also recommend using an external charger like this one I have\xc2\xa0Nitecore D2 Charger with LCD Display Universal Smart Charger For Rechargeable Batteries IMR/Li-ion/LiFePO4/Ni-MH/Ni-Cd\xc2\xa0though if you don\'t have one the built in charger does work but it\'s always a good idea to use a dedicated charger on devices like this.I like the LED function (the LEDs that actually illuminate the fan blades not the external LED) a bit better than the other portable fans I have because they are shielded and don\'t "leak" light everywhere like other models.  So it\'s just a bit more pleasant than other fans LEDs and the external LED works fine but my only complaint is the fact you can only use the LED on the side when the fan itself is off.  It goes - Low - Medium - High - LED and you hold down the On button for 4 seconds to turn on the LEDs that light the fan blades.I\'m not sure why I did such an in-depth review of this silly little fan but there it is.  Would purchase again.', b"I LOVE this fan. it's pretty small and fits almost anywhere. My laptop sits on a venting board with some extra USB connectors. I use one of these extra connectors to plug in the fan. It only has 1 speed but it's perfect when you need a little extra airflow and turning up the AC in a room/office isn't an option. While there is a bit of hum from the air, the motor is pretty quiet and certainly not a bother to me. it feels pretty solid and I expect it be around for many years. Friends who have stopped in my office and saw it like it and have purchased one, too.", b"I've only been using this fan for a few days but I have to say 'so far' it's perfect. I work in an office off a truck shop and, in order to keep the smell of oil and such out of the desk area, we close our office door regularly.  This little fan does a great job of circulating the air in my corner of the room.  I'm considering buying another one to take along to concerts or other gatherings."]}

But the quality of every decal is near perfect. I went through the pile a few times and not one duplicate. I foresee me buying a few more of these decal packs!", b'The Love Sticker 100 piece Pack that I got is great! I have been looking for something to decorate my laptop with because they do not make skins for the one I have so this kit is perfect.The stickers that came in my pack are exactly what is shown in the love sticker set picture. I did count them and there are 100 different stickers as promised. The different categories are brand logos, comics/superhero/cartoons, skater life, music/bands, animals, cars, ect. The pack has so many random but popular stickers so it appeals to almost all ages.Because of the different shapes and sizes it is easy to find the perfect way for them to all fit into a big collage on the top of my laptop. I had left over stickers even after I covered my laptop so my son used the rest on his Xbox and such.These stickers have so many uses and look amazing! I am very happy with my order and I would order them again. I just might try a different pack next time being I have this one already.', b'Great set of stickers. High quality with lots of variety.', b'The stickers are good quality. My only gripe is that there are so many "brand" stickers. I don\'t like paying for Starbucks or Nike logo stickers. Not sure why I\'m paying to advertise for these companies... In any case, I threw those out. BE WARNED! Some of these stickers aren\'t for kids under 14-15 years old. You can pick through them though. I kept some for myself ;o)', b"These stickers are great, I really enjoyed getting them and picking out my favorites, but the pictures are misleading. There are a lot of stickers shown in the pictures, which are NOT in the package. Lucky for me the ones I REALLY wanted were there, but some of the ones I was looking forward to getting were not there. So overall great quality product, just misleading photos.UPDATE: One of the stickers, wasn't even a sticker, it was just a piece of paper.", b"a pretty good random assortment of high-quality stickers. Expect a few odd topic stickers that may or may not correlate with your moral compass, it's ok, they won't hurt you (paper cuts maybe if you are reckless) Tere were about 8-10 wasted stickers including duplicates of a company (Supreme being a frustratingly common and dull sticker) and Generic Clipart type stickers.If you like stickers this is a good booster pack style collection. There is usually 5-7 unique exciting stickers.MORE anime, classic cartoons, and unique company variants. STOP overused pop culture icons such as the Minions, Hulk, and the Simpsons.", b"I was worried I would not like most of the stickers, but I ended up loving more than half of them. I didn't count them but I am sure there is 100. The first package gives you the exact stickers shown in the picture. There are only 1 or 2 'inappropriate' stickers in the entire package so if you're getting it for kids be sure to check through them. Great quality and so much fun. I loved going through each of them and sorting them out. I don't even know where to put all of them because there's so many I liked! Lots of DC and Marvel characters as well as brand logos."]}

ASUS makes some high-end gaming laptops like the ROG that sell for over $2000.  That is like buying a Telsa in the car world.  If that is what you are looking for then by all means spend the money and enjoy it.  But if you just need basic functions like web browsing, email and writing documents and you don't want spend much money then this is a great deal.  It's kind of like buying a Ford Fiesta for your commute car because you just need something to get you to work and back.  In my case, I needed an inexpensive laptop for my son and this is perfect.  I have spend the day testing it out and am very impressed.  I'm honestly stunned that you get this much for around $250.  Right now we are all listening to Christmas music on Pandora in the living room. Earlier I was showing him Skype video messaging on the web cam which worked great.  Window 10 boots up very quickly and the screen backgrounds are beautiful  The laptop looks sleek  and professional.  The trackpad actually works better then my more expensive Thinkpad laptop.  With 500GB hard drive he is never going to run out of space.  In our case the WiFi works great so maybe we are just lucky there.  So I think people who purchase this laptop for the right reasons will be happy.  Just remember this is not a Tesla but then again you are paying about a tenth of the cost and from that perspective this is a great purchase.", b'Great computer and I would recommend it to any and everyone. I would have given it 5 stars, but the Windows 10 is the biggest issue with this product. I cant hold ASUS responsible, but fair warning, one of the updates will cause the computer to shut down and you have to reset the OS back to factory settings, and Microsoft is not a huge help on the problem', b'Like many others have stated, this computer is not as advertised. For me the issue was a slower processor than stated in the specs. The computer I received was a 1.6Ghz processor. The advertisement stated it was 1.6 - 2.4. When i checked the specs it clearly stated that i was buying the 2.4Ghz unit. Today I looked at the specs and  it says its 4.6Ghz which is ridiculous. I guess they are trying to use the defense of "whoops, that was a mistake". Its not a mistake, its fraud.The computer is slow and really only good for basic internet browsing, watching movies, office work. I wouldn\'t buy this if your looking to upgrade unless your old computer is over 8 years old or running windows vista or an older operating system.', b'Very fast so far. I have only owned HP but the last HP only lasted 1 1/2 year and went through 2 Hard drives and finally died...Calling HP is pointless ...Asus is so willing to help which is why I ended up going with them.  So far I am loving this!', b"My husband ordered 2 of these in January, both for the same purpose - access to the internet, basic use of office suite, nothing fancy. Price point and functionality for what we needed looked good. From the start, both had Wifi connection issues - connecting, getting kicked off, then unable to reconnect to the same connection I was just on, and so on. Having had other devices connected to the same signal, full strength, and both computers having the same issue, did lead me to conclude it was a problem with the computers. And, I see now that some of the other reviews indicate the same.The one we took to our store, though the spotty Wifi issues are super irritating, is otherwise working fine for our basic needs. The one we kept at home completely died at 4 months. The battery died and will not charge at all. We purchased a replacement charger, hoping that was the issue - it was not. When plugged in to either, the computer shows no indication of trying to charge. Other reviews indicate the same.So, I'm chalking this up to a 'you get what you pay for' scenario, though at the very least I would expect the cheapest of computers to 1. Hold a charge & 2. Connect to the internet - but I digress. I've had better experience with laptops in the $400-$600 range such that I would definitely say this computer is not worth the couple hundred dollar savings. Still not sure whether I will go through the hassle of having the manufacturer reconcile this, as we are past our return window with Amazon.", b"Honestly was disappointed when I first saw it,  I really didn't want a huge laptop,  and didn't notice that it had the number if keyboard like a regular desktop keyboard.HOWEVER it is very slick and lightweight in design so that makes up for the bunk in the length.Windows 10 is not so bad. I prefer windows 7 personally...but windows 10 to me reminds me if windows 7 and 8 had a kids,  then 10 would be thee kid.  I haven't had a whole lot of time to play with the inter workings and software,  will try to update late.", b'This is the third ASUS computer in our home. First one retired, second in my 13.3", and the third is this one for my wife at Christmas. It is a great value. Windows 10 is a bit different than the XP desktop she has been used to for many years, but was easy for her to find her way around. There are more similarities than one realizes. She likes the Start page with all the icons set her way. My Honey is happy!!!The system is quite responsive with both the touchpad and a Bluetooth mouse that was added. Bluetooth would have been a nice addition. The hard drive is more capacity than she will ever use, but .... There is sufficient memory for anything that she will be doing, with primary interests in a few online games, Facebook, and searching for life\'s questions. The screen is bright and color is very good and glare doesn\'t seem to be an issue. We did a Facebook video chat Christmas and it was a great success. The quality of the chat was wonderful and made the day perfect. All in all a GREAT buy from a GREAT company.There are some personal negatives that don\'t affect the 5 star rating in any way. ASUS adds too many third party apps on the system. I deleted most of them. The Express Settings which is recommended allows for too much Microsoft monitoring and data gathering. Quickly put IE on the taskbar , blocked Edge, and downloaded Chrome.Don\'t hesitate to purchase this system from Amazon. You won\'t be disappointed.']}

Unfortunately my 17" laptop will not fit and I had to return this.  The dimensions of my laptop are 16.5 x 10.75 x 1.25.  When the laptop is placed in the backpack it will stick out about 2" too far and the zippers will not zip.  One review that I read said that he used a knife to cut off the bottom of the padding and was able to get their 17" device to fit. The specifications for the pack say that it is 19.5" lengthwise however the rounded ends cut the maximum device length to 14.5".', b'I dont usually write reviews but i read them alot and base my purchases on them. Im writing this review because i feel the negative reviews are NOT warented. No bag is a perfect fit for everyone and every need. That being said, this is a great bag. Great material big heavy duty zippers and great construction. here are my thoughts on the negative reviews. i will give the negative review then my opinon;1) bag by itself is heavyA) who carries an empty bag? and yet the same review says bag is lighter than expected when full.  heavy by itself and lighter than expected when full?  hopefully you can see my issue with this one.2)straps are too short.A) I am only 5\'7" so i cant comment on this one except they are fine for me and have plenty of room for adjustment3)bag does not stand uprightA) mine does. i did take the hard board out of the laptop compartment though as i dont like that ( more on that later)4) pouches are too small to fit anything useful in themA) i can fit all kinds of things in them from keys notepads sync or charger cables headphones(earbuds) extra camera battery and chargerbeleive it or not you dont have to use every pocket only for the intended or labled purpose.5)back painA) REALLY????  Sipping this one6)doesnt fit under airline seat when flatA) havnt flown with this yet. if it doesnt fit then this pack sure holds alot. and it does7) red stain from laptop pocketA) i havnt encountered this but again i did take out the hard board wich gave it a real snug fit ( i like it better without the hard board)8)starap mounted phone pocket is too smallA) YES IT IS!!!  i use it for my ipod wich works great and it has the headphone hole (works great for that) and i  like my phone in my pocket anyway because its easier to get to than unzipping a pocket9)water bottle holder is not a "true waterbottle holder"A) that is correct. it is more of another pocket wich i like better. i never really need water at a quick draw location. i usually dont walk for miles without stopping at points in between and i can use the zippered pocket for other things. it will hold a water bottle though just not as well as others10) laptop charger pocket is too smallA) depends on your charger. Again you dont have to use all pockets for their labeled use. put things where they fit.  there is plenty of room11) pen holders are too far down and damage pensA) just not true. they dont even go to the bottom of the bag to hit on the ground when you set bag down12)No key clip in front pocket as advertised \xe2\x80\x93 the tag on the bag shows a key clip however this is not present on the final product.A) should of read the tag properly. it clearly says not all features included in every bag.  it is simply an advertisment of their "red protection" style of pockets13)doesnt fit 17" laptopA) no it wont. it says in the description "fits most 15" laptops.  if you have a 17\' try the gambit bag. same as the renegade without the "RSS" system wich shortens the laptop pocket by a few inches.About the hardboard in the laptop cpocket:  there is a piece of hard plastic like board that is in the laptop pocket. it is on the front bottom and back of the pocket and is one piece. it makes the laptop a very snug fit. i didnt like it, and it was bent from packaging making uncomfortable to where also. i simply turned the pocket inside out and pulled out the hard board ( had to bend it to get it out) that made the pocket have much more room and a better fit. it also allowed the pack to rest flat against my back.Overall this is a very well made and good looking pack with lots of room and plenty of organization ( assuming your smart enough to put things where they fit) Oh ant the crush proof tech vault is an awsome idea and love it. Great pack and am very happy. i will update after a few months of abuse.  hope this helps', b'I started traveling for work and needed something organized and tough to get me across the country. I am very impressed with this bag. I was able to snag one for $99 + Shipping and would not hesitate to buy another one for $150 at the drop of hat. While its not for everyone, if you are reading this you know some stuff about it already and whether it might work for you or not, if you are considering it I think you would be hard pressed to find a better bag. I LOVE mine.Major strengths for me were/are.*Strong laptop padding*Large amount of storage but still fits under all major airline seats when full*Easy access to sides and well organized*DURABLE! (Mine has now flown 30+ times as well as thousands of miles of driving and probably 100 miles walking/working) It currently shows very little signs of wear. The insides are holding up well, all the straps are in great condition, and all of the zippers are still easy to use and feel strong.', b'I bought the backpack to replace my 10 year old Ogio bag that had finally given its last and the stitching near handle started to give out.  I probably could have tried to fix it but got a good price on this one so I pulled the trigger. This bag is my daily driver and also my "personal item" whenever I\'m flying for work - 10-12 per year.  I\'ve lugged the bag around airports for hours on end (delays are inevitable) and between the chest strap and the nicely padded shoulder straps, I have emerged from the ordeal no worse for the wear.  The bag fits nicely under the seat, even on the little regional jets which is a HUGE plus.  I have a picture included of my "normal" stuff that I\'m taking with me - will usually also include a case for Bose headphones and souvenirs for the wife and kids on the return leg.  I\'ve never had an issue with storage, the main compartment expands very nicely and the extra side pockets make everything easy to get to.Also my daily driver which includes regular trips to and from work on a motorcycle.  Again, comfort is great, the bag sits very still on my back even on the interstate where speeds are ummm, we\'ll say pretty high.  Takes a lot of abuse with wind and rain and road debris - looks almost as good as the day I bought.Pros:StrongComfortableTons of StorageGood for carry on luggageCons:I\'ve got nothing - love this bag']}

When you get into the ~$1000 range, the price/performance ratio seems to be at its best. If you\'re hoping the Lenovo fits the bill, I\'m excited to say it does all that plus more, for the most part.Before I get too far, I did not purchase this laptop for the current $1129 on Amazon, and I got it at Costco for $999. It\'s the better deal for the same configuration and a much better warranty if you can go with it.OVERVIEW:The model comes equipped with most of the high-end specs you\'d expect. A fast 7th Gen i7, a strong mid-range 1050 ti NVidia card, 16GB of 2400 ram, 256 SSD and 2TB HDD, and an IPS display (so no washed out angles). For ports with have 2x 3.0, 2.0, USB-C (no thunderbolt), HDMI, and a headphone jack. Unfortunately, there is no display port, so you are limited in some regards.I could not connect my 144hz panel to this laptop, as DP is required to get it to work at that refresh rate. USB-C to DP may work, but I have not tried it yet. The bigger issue is that the NVidia Control Panel is gimped because of the laptop utilizing the Intel GPU for the display. I have been spoiled by higher end Sager and Asus laptops (1080 and 1060 respectively) that have the iGPU turned off, so the NVidia card controls everything, resulting in no issues (but also shorter battery life).DISPLAYThe laptop display is above average. It is an IPS panel, so the viewing angles are perfect and no washing out of colors or contrast like most laptops have with TN panels. The good comments end there, however. The screen brightness is lower than on most laptops. Couple this with its very low SRGB color space and it became especially underwhelming. I have noticed eye strain, but I do not have enough time with the laptop yet to determine 100% if it is the screen. I have completed a displaycal calibration with the i1Display X-Rite, and the results were as I expected: About 54% SRGB and 38% AdobeRGB. It\'s a low grade IPS screen overall, but it is still better than the other laptops below this price range (especially the Dell with competing specs as of right now. which as a low grade TN panel). Note: After calibration and tuning up the saturation about 15-20%, the screen feels a little better. It was heavily shifted to green from the overview before calibration.The screen is mainly the biggest draw back from the package fortunately!PERFORMANCEHere is where the laptop shines. It is a decently sized desktop replacement that stays cool and quiet. Sure, you can get much stronger laptops (or the literal desktop replacement from Sager that weighs 12lb), but noise and overheating will start to become bigger drawbacks. If you need a medium sized 15.6" laptop to travel with, it\'s a good decision! I am comfortably able to carry it around without stress and even one hand it without struggling.CPU:The i7-7700HQ is a decent ~10% upgrade to the 6th gen. As with the past few generations of Intel chips, they are basically incremental upgrades with beefier iGPUs. It\'s as fast as the desktop i7 from a few generations past (2700k, 3770k, 4770k), and matches or sometimes beats my laptop champion i7-4900mq in rendering times. For gaming, you won\'t see much difference from the i5 7th gen laptops you see for $100-300 cheaper, so if gaming is all you care about, you may want to spend less for the same performance. The CPU can get a bit hot under 100% load (77-80C), but maxing the fan will help. This is all without changing the out of box thermal paste, so I expect better long term cooling/performance with the application.GPU:Like the CPU, the NVidia 1050 ti met all of my standards: Can it play Overwatch on High/Ultra above 60fps. Yes. All other games were icing on the cake. The good news is that under max load, I was peaking at around ~63C (other laptops with the 1060 and above easily hit above 80C) after a straight hour of playtime and then letting it hang on the menu for another 30 minutes (used HW Monitor to check low and max temps). With max fans turned on, I was getting ~55C at 100% of GPU use. It idles around 25-30C when web browsing and general use. I noticed a little screen tearing, but the frame-rate stayed a consistent custom 60-70, and I may just be used to 120+Hz panels at this point. Overall, I was highly impressed! It won\'t blow your socks off with performance, but with this laptop, my main concern was a quiet and efficient machine I could easily carry with me when I do not need the behemoth  that is the Sager NP9873.MULTIMEDIA EDITINGI was able to easily edit 1080p and UHD footage in Premiere Pro and edit/draw in Photoshop and Illustrator without a hitch. I would not use this screen for ANY color sensitive materials, however. Hooking it up to a color monitor works very well though on all of the Adobe Suite.GAMINGLike Overwatch, some of my other tests went as well. The Phantom Pain, Resident Evil 7, Doom, Alien Isolation, GTA V and Rust all handled at above 60fps at High settings. In some cases I even was able to hit Ultra in Doom without any frame drops. For casual gaming, it does its job. Don\'t expect any serious gaming above 1080p except for older titles.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADWith a red illuminated backing (with an off, low, and high setting) and a tactile high quality matte plastic design, it feels like the sibling of MSIs top laptop keyboards. The touchpad also surprised my expectations. I\'ve been burnt laptop touchpads (espcially the recent Asus Strix lineup), but I have nothing negative to say. Very impressed overall!DESIGNIf you\'re looking for a "gaming" look, go for the new Acer machine. The exterior is very business and plain looking with a cheaper plastic design. It attracts visible fingerprints rather easily. The interior is a mixture of matte and brushed aluminum, which I rather like. But you know what? I love this! It keeps the laptop out of the spotlight and ensures not only a professional vibe, but may keep potential theft out of your way.AUDIOThe audio is nothing to write home about, but has above average clarity and volume compared to other laptops in this range. I prefer MSI or Sager\'s audio, but I don\'t mind listening to music on the machine. Gaming with a critical ear (ex. Overwatch) is not recommended, however.STORAGEThe M.2 PCIe SSD has an average read speed of 1600 MB/s and the 2TB 5400RPM HDD has an average read speed of 139 MB/s (very good average!). No complaints here!BATTERY LIFEDon\'t expect anything usable for a full day. I got about  3 hours with balanced performance web work. It varies a lot depending on what you\'re doing. Don\'t expect to game more than an hour or two max off of battery. However, given that this is a gaming/performance based laptop, I will rarely use it without the charger anyway. As long as I can write for a few hours on the side, that\'s all I care about, and it gets the job done good enough.BUILT IN SOFTWAREIn short, very little bloatware, thank you! The Lenovo software is basic. You can max the fans, adjust the Dolby sound, network settings, and check your video recordings. Video recordings? Well, this laptop actually has a key on the keyboard that instantly starts recording your screen. Useful for tutorials and whatnot.CONCLUSIONAll in all, if you\'re looking for a solid price to performance ratio laptop that is easy to carry with you, definitely consider the Lenovo Y520. Casual and hardcore gamers will find a lot to love here, and  video or photo editing folks (who don\'t need to rely on a laptop screen for color accuracy) will feel at home. The specs are solid, and  the 15.6" size is great. My only complaint is the slightly cheap feeling exterior plastic and the low quality IPS panel. Other than that, this is one of my most recommended budget desktop replacements as of April 2017!-Quick Overview-Pros:1) Cost/Performance ratio is solid2) Matte IPS Panel for perfect viewing angles3) Awesome CPU, Cool GPU, 16GB 2400 speed ram, and two HDDs provide a mid-tier desktop replacementCons:1) Screen brightness/contrast is low and color is unacceptable for anybody editing photos/videos2) Battery life on the low side with 3 Cell battery (~3 hours)3) External build seems more like a ~$500 laptop4) No Thunderbolt 3 or Display Port', b"Well, I have to say I love this laptop.  It boots from a cold start in about 6 seconds.  It has been able to play everything in my Steam library at high settings with an average of 60 - 70 fps.  Some games from the last year even play at that frame rate on ultra settings.  It may not be a master race beast slayer with a GTX 1080, but it also is pretty darn light and quiet for the performance.  I won't list all the specs and whatnot, if your thoughtfully considering a purchase of a gaming laptop you have probably already read the specs and more than a few reviews.  But what I will say is that this laptop can handle anything you can throw at it and without sounding like a turbine engine spooling up or feeling like you have a cinder block on your lap.The only downside is that though it does have a USB-C port, that port does not have Thunderbolt support and the HDMI is routed through the Intel Graphics, not directly off the GTX 1050 ti.  So if you really want to run through an external monitor and have the same performance you get off the internal display you might want to look at the y720.  That'd be a couple hundred bucks extra for a similar build, or the same price as this but with an i5 and no SSD.  But if I want to use my TV I just run through Steam link and it works great.My favorite way to use my computer is lying in bed, and this is a perfect bedtop.  Just get a simple chillpad to go under it, as all the air intake is from the bottom.My shipping came three days after I ordered it and I've been loving it for a month.  And you can get an extended warranty through Lenovo, even with accidental damage protection pretty reasonably.  Also it isn't hard to get the back off and change out the drives if you're technically inclined.All in all, this is a great laptop and if you turn off the backlit keyboard, you can take it to work and nobody would think you were playing Battlefield 1 when you really should be doing those TPS reports...", b'So fast, so clear, so good.Everything about this Laptop is exactly what I hoped it would be.  I told my daughter; "It\'s so nice to make a big purchase and be totally satisfied and have all your expectations met."  That\'s exactly how I feel about this.  Runs every game we\'ve got at max graphics.  I am in love with this laptop!', b"I bought this laptop due to the price and its characteristics. I used to have a Lenovo y700 laptop but the GPU failed without reason so I had many doubts whether to buy this equipment or not. So far there's no problem with this one, I haven't tried playing games or heavy load on the CPU or GPU but for what I can see this machine flies! Will make an update as soon as I play some games in this beast...", b'I am a VR/BIM modeler and gamer at times. I use REVIT, 3dsMAX, CAD, SketchUp, Photoshop and Play DOTA2 and they all work super smooth. My Revit Models are enormous and it can handle it very well.  I am SO happy with this laptop! The red keyboard is not too intense as it may look, you can turn on/adjust the keyboard light also. There is no disc drive or VGA you have to use either USB-C or HDMI.', b'this was a great deal, this one works smoothly, i lets render a huge amount of content really fast and efficiently. I havent gamed with it, but for the work done on it so far, its a bargain', b'Love it.  Performs fantastic and gives many hours of pleasure and business satisfaction.', b'The price is unbeatable.The battery life is ridiculous though as in any  laptop of this line.']}

I don't love it, but I like it.The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because sometimes it's REALLY fussy.

It also doesn't want to load up things sometimes, like it acknowledged I'd tried to open whatever it was, but just couldn't connect and stopped. Sometimes I have to restart the computer just to get it to allow me to open something. I can't imagine what's causing that. I've updated my Windows version, so... yeah. Some kind of software issues, but I can't figure out why it just won't do anything sometimes.Anyhow, I didn't buy this to play Skyrim or something.

So far it has not been tasked with any large Excel file or the likes of that but i suspect this one will be used as a spare in the household.  It streams video very well.  Have watched Netflix on it without any spooling.  Particularly like the keyboard.  Fits my hands well and the touch is very nice.

As an IT professional I have worked with many computers and laptops over the years. I personally own a Macbook Pro which is a very fast computer. This notebook is remarkably fast... even when using it on the internet, which is where most computers struggle in every day use. This is the fourth Asus product I have purchased. I am a very big fan. I would highly recommend this item to anyone looking for an everyday notebook as long as they do not require much onboard storage. But I definitely suggest going with the 64GB drive as the 32GB drive is not large enough to facilitate some Windows updates.', b'I purchased this for one reason... watching training videos from the internet.  After the initial updating of the OS (Windows 10) the laptop does its job just fine.  (Caution it will take several hours to get the OS updated)The audio quality from the speakers is good enough I can listen to videos without the need for headphones.Works fine for other things like web mail and general web surfing.  Amazon works fine in fact I am typing this review using the device.The keyboard is a bit noisy like others have noted, but does not take away from its ability to do its job. Small.. lightweight... and works... what else could you want from a Netbook type device.', b"I have had this for a couple of weeks now, and I can't believe the value for what I got. After totally wasting my money on an HP Stream a couple of years ago I was VERY hesitant about buying another budget laptop, but this one so far is a winner. The good: Keyboard- I have fairly large hands and have no problem typing. The keys feel responsive and solid. The screen- good enough by far for what you are paying for. The speakers- surprisingly very, very good. Volume is great and as long as you don't crank it up too high the clarity is just fine. Wi-Fi- spectacular; connected right up to my home wifi and never misses a beat. This was one of the (many) problems with the P.O.C. HP Stream so this was a big relief. Speed- so it's not blazing fast but it's not snail slow either, for $200 it's right where it should be. Memory- I knew going in to it what I was getting- I plan to use this on a 5 month trip basically to keep in touch and look at pictures I take before dumping them on to an external hard drive; so internal hard drive memory is not that important. As far as RAM- I can stream Spotify or Amazon Music no problem and stream videos with Amazon Prime. All for $200, what's not to like? Battery life- hours and hours. I have not timed it exactly but the thing goes forever on a full charge.I went through the updates for Windows and there were no problems, all straight forward and glitch less.The so-so: The only thing that could be improved perhaps is the touchpad. It's not very sensitive and I usually have to tap more than one time to get something to register. But I am going to be using a USB mouse anyway so I don't rally care too much.The description says this machine is semi-spill proof and rugged- made for grade schoolers. This should be a perfect travel laptop for doing non-memory intensive chores. Throw it in your backpack and forget it. If it get's stolen or crushed, not the end of the world.  What a bargain!I will post another update after my trip and relate how well it stood up-", b'Love this little lightweight laptop!! I am going on a trip and didn\'t want to bring my 17" laptop - this is fantastic - and I don\'t need to bring my Kindle now either! Great construction, durable - more ram for this type of computer than the ones Best Buy had in stock. And unlike a Chromebook, I can run Flash and play WordTornado!', b'Really pretty design and so durable. My only thing is I wish it was touchscreen. I personally think this will make it better.', b"Got this short notice for some work that required portable windows. Works fine, memory is a bit small but otherwise worked fine for my project. The screen border material seems a bit flimsy, but haven't had any other issues with it so far.For the price it's a pretty solid little computer, if under powered. Works just fine for browsing though. Good for kids I'd say.", b'This laptop seemed great in terms of durability and sturdiness. It was also very portable. However, the screen quality is very poor and the color was terrible. All images and colors appeared very washed out. This would not be a problem for a kid using it for school, but if someone was using it for something that depends on color (even low-level editing of jpeg photos) this is not the machine for you.', b'Too many problems setting it up.

It is not the HA65NS5-00 that is listed as the first model number.  It is just the LA65NS2 that is listed as the second model number.  These model numbers are not interchangeable as the LA65NS2 has a much bigger port and can not be used.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why these models are grouped together under the same listing, but it amounts to false advertising and just an extra hassle of having to return a useless charger if you want the HA65NS5-00.', b"I bought two of them hoping to keep a spare at my desk and one at work without having to drag the one i keep in my luggage around. Both chargers failed to charge the battery, they show on the labels that they are Dell 19.5v 3.34A chargers but they will only hold my batter at its current charge, and will not charge the laptop. One of them actually wont even hold it at its current rate and it finally let the battery die while i wasn't paying attention. When i started the laptop back up, i got an error saying that the charger is not a dell charger and does not provide enough current.@$25 for two its not even worth the hassle to package them back up and bring them to UPS to return.", b"I was really excited and looking forward to receiving my charger because my other one only lasted about a year however this one extremely disappointed me saying is it only lasted for about a month. The port part ended up crooked and is coming out of the actual cord. I take very good care of my stuff and this happens.'(", b'PIECE OF CRAP!!!!  Do not waste your Money on this Cheap JUNK!  I purchased this in October and FIVE months later...it stopped working!!!!And of course the Seller wont replace it!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!', b'The wires that attach to the plug are exposed and appear to not be long enough to remain attached securely.  Fire hazard. After reading some of the other reviews, I can for certain say I will definitely never order from this company again.  I ordered the product in February and the wires were exposed after 2 months of use.  Vendor did also not respond to any requests for a replacement product or refund.', b'So I know I had recommended this but now I am not so sure.  I had expected it to last for more than a year; however right on the brink of 12 months it just stopped charging my laptop.  So I either have to take my chances and buy another one from Amazon or get one directly from Dell.. very disappointed.', b'Works very well. At first, I thought there was something wrong with my laptop. I decided to try the less expensive route and get a new charger. Dell has some that are "compatible", but have differed items numbers.  This one has the same item numbers as my original one.  Hope it lasts as long.', b'These kids of purchases are hit and miss, and they wear out quickly at the point of connection to the tip.']}

When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

This time, the blue charging light came on and the computer powered up.I still cannot in good conscience recommend this computer, because of what happened below, but as of today, it continues to charge and to work.Update:I really wanted to like this tablet.  It worked well - for a short time (see below).  The problem is that two days after the 30-day return policy expired, it died.  I plugged in the charger and set it on my table, as I always do.  The charge light came on.  Two hours later the charge light was off and I tried to turn it on.  Nothing.  Nadda.  The tablet was dead.  In plugging the charger back in the next day, no charge light and the tablet will not start, with the charger plugged in or not.I contacted the seller, and they said they would not help.  I get it, it was a WHOLE two days after the 30 day period.  I own a business, and you bend the rules and honor these things behind the scenes to keep good customers happy, but they chose not to.  They suggested I contact the manufacturer.  We all know how that goes.  Send it in back on your dime, wait a few months, they let you know that your $120 tablet will cost $100 to fix, and you may get it back in another three months.  No thanks.Previous review:Okay, I bought this tablet a week ago, and here are my thoughts.  Note that I am writing this review on this tablet.First of all let me premise this review saying that you really have to review products based on their merit and expected use.  You should not compare this tablet to a $500 tablet, nor should you buy it and try to use it beyond its capabilities, expecting it to work well for you.  If I review a burger joint I don\'t ding them because they didn\'t have hot green tea on the menu.That stated, this cheap little tablet is almost amazing for the price.  I\'ve tried to use it as a desktop replacement for the office, so not a lot of processor or memory intensive work.  It has worked flawlessly.  I\'ve even taken it to our sailboat and done a bit of video and video editing (720p), on it. It processed the videos (PowerDirector Mobile) much faster than I expected, and I was able to upload the completed video to Youtube.I currently have Chrome browser with four tabs open, the Facebook app, and the mail app.  There is no hesitation when switching between apps.  Then I open Firefox, and still just as fast.  No problems here.The touch screen works very well.  Sometimes these cheaper tablets have cheesy touch screens - not this one.  The keyboard could be better.  The keys have a bit too much spring and you have to press down on them, but not a deal breaker at all, and I am still able to type just fine.  The mouse pad works well, as expected.  Typical of PCs these days, the function keys are linked to brightness, volume, and other things.The battery life could be better.  I think I may get about two to three hours out of it, but again you have to think in terms of getting what you pay for.  For the price I paid I didn\'t expect this tablet to have the best battery life. I have not tested it in battery saver mode, but I expect that would help.  It will last long enough to take to our favorite pub for the evening.The styling could be called functional.  It\'s not pretty, but it is functional.  Not sure just how much it weighs, but it is very light, especially the tablet detached from the keyboard.The only other thing that bothers me is the charger.  It takes a few hours to charge the tablet.  That doesn\'t sound bad, but a few hours to charge, to use it on battery for a few hours means you have to plan ahead.  If the charger were a bit more powerful, it would help.  Someone else here mentioned that they should have used the mini USB as a charging port, but I would disagree.  I\'d prefer not wearing out one of the USB ports to charge the battery.The internal storage is limited, but I\'ve added a 64 gig SD card, so I have a drive "D" with the additional space.In conclusion you might ask if I would buy this tablet again.  The answer is a resounding yes!  I would also recommend it to a friend.  It does everything that a full blown Windows 10 laptop does, and it does it almost as fast, as long as you don\'t overload it by having too many processes running at once.  I\'ve watched Youtube videos in high def, browsed all sorts of websites, done minor video editing, run office programs to get my work done at the office, and generally had fun with this little (almost) jewel.', b'I was looking for a tablet with a keyboard and a full size USB port and decided on this RCA Cambio. This little laptop/tablet has a lot of features for the price and a great supplement to my 16" laptop. The only thing I wish was different is the power on button as it is a little small, and I have to look for it to turn it on. The keyboard is a mini, but  I expected that and don\'t intend to use it for extended typing. This tablet is the perfect size to take along for photo presentations, travel, etc. I\'m really glad I made this purchase. This review was made by a 78 year old computer savvy grandma.', b'It worked great for about 5 months.  Then it turn on, then go to a black screen.  There was no saving it.  When it actually worked, sometimes it had little issues like the touch screen being a little off or something so the keyboard helped with areas it lacked.  Battery life went fast, but it charged fast and was perfect for all day college class I was taking on the weekends.  Too bad it died and after reading the other reviews, this happens to all of them.', b'The RCA Cambio provides all of the power you would ever need in a small computer. It is a full-featured computer with Windows 10.The only serious disadvantage of the the Cambio is the file storage memory limitation due to the backup copy of Windows 10 that is automatically saved in case you need to reload Windows 10.  There is also the option of purging the backup copy. If you want to retain the backup copy, there is a simple and low-cost resolution for this is to add a micro SDHC card.I use mine for photography work. I upload pictures from my camera to view them during a photography session. This allows me to retake shots in the event there is a problem with the picture.', b"My first impression was that it was too heavy, but it grew on me and I really liked it. I didn't use it often and after a couple of weeks it just didn't come back on after shutdown. And I'd purchased a memory stick and cover (runs out of memory pretty quickly)", b"You get what you pay for, it does the job, the keys feel a little cheap, and overall performance doesn't seem as good as other similar 32GB Atom tablets, but it works well enough, and the full size USB port on the tablet body itself is extremely useful. If I'm reading it right, it's showing up as a USB 3.0 port.I've updated my review, I needed to reinstall Windows and forgot to backup the old drivers. So, I went to support, and their support options as of today are terrible. You can't download drivers, you have to email RCA for them, and when you email them, the email address fails. So, based on support, had to drop this to a 2 from 4 star.", b"This tablet is actually a lot better than I expected after reading the reviews.  I would've given it a 5 except for a few issues.  I hope this product review is not a reflection of the seller because they were just great.  I thought I had an issue but they responded quickly to my questions and got me through it.  The issue i'm having is a connectivity problem between the tablet and the keyboard.  Also when i switch to using it without a keyboard, the onscreen keyboard doesnt come up so i can type. The battery life is pretty bad but I don't usually need it for long.  It says it supports up to 32GB SD card but i successfully used a 64gb.  wish the camera had more megapixels and could take a better picture.", b"The only complaint I had with my Cambio was that I couldn't get the User Manual downloaded.  I found a Customer Service Phone Number for RCA online  (800-252-6123) I got a Service Rep on my second try.  When I explained my problem, he immediately emailed the entire Manual to me.  It was 37 pages, which used a bit of ink of course; but I will have it to refer to as long as I have the Cambio.  I believe it will be useful when traveling as well as at home."]}

Was very nervous about getting a refurbished unit. Bought this because of the reviews and price point for what you get. There were only 8 reviews but they were all pretty positive. First off the packaging was very good, I'm guessing from the seller or the Refurbisher. Amazon packaging left a lot to be desired. The laptop came in a highly pressurized plastic sleeve inside a box for protection. The laptop I received was in brand new condition. There was not a scratch, smudge, fingerprint, dust ding or dent. This thing looks fantastic. Fired it up and went through the install BS. Everything is okay.The touch pad works just fine. So far so good. ***update*** nothing bad but a buyer beware notice. The pictures show a black laptop with the dvd drive on the right side, the last picture shows a silver laptop which is the one I received and the dvd is on the left side. no big deal but you have to pay attention to the small details. If the dvd drive is on two different sides then these are two different models, which one are you buying! which one do you get. ? The specs were as they should be and I am very pleased so far. Connected to wifi easily and didn't drop, download speeds are great, screen is great. Not sure about battery life as I leave it plugged in so far.", b'Mine arrived with Ethernet DOA. Each time I tried to install an Ethernet driver, whether from HP\'s web site or letting Windows Device Manager search for it,  the computer would cold boot, logging nothing. Doing a "repair while retaining all apps" reinstallation of Windows 10 from a thumb drive fixed the problem.  I\'ll start with general comments about the laptop, and then go through what I did to get it mine to a "well-behaved" state.General comments:This laptop is big and heavy compared to most available today. Many laptop bags will be too small for it. But it is cheap and the screen is large. I use it as my primary everyday "desktop" machine at home. The large screen size was my primary reason for buying it. If you want a laptop you are going to carry around with you every day, this is not the one. It\'s too heavy and the battery time (~2 hours) isn\'t enough.But I can easily move this laptop to wherever I want to work in my house or take it with me in a carry-on bag when traveling.When I want a second screen, I plug in an AOC portable USB monitor (available on Amazon starting at about $100), and I have a 4TB external USB hard drive that is small enough to fit in my pocket. With this laptop, neither the USB drive nor the monitor need an external power cable. This laptop has one USB 3.0 port on each side. I recommend using a USB 3.0 portable extension hub (one that plugs into the USB port and doesn\'t need external power). These hubs are available on Amazon for about $15.This laptop is not suitable for gaming or specialized compute or IO-intensive tasks. It\'s for everyday tasks--email, web surfing, Office programs, etc. I even use it for amateur audio and video editing and recording, and it keeps up fine. The 1 TB internal hard drive is a nice touch -- many people may not even have a need for extra storage. Watching movies on it is just fine. You may want to add an external USB Blu-Ray burner--these are small and cheap, under $100 now. Pioneer makes very good ones. I don\'t know if the included Cyberlink movie player software includes a license to play Blu-Rays--you may have to buy additional software.Usually, extended warranties are not worth the money, but I\'d recommend getting the one offered by Amazon for this laptop. Electronics tend to fail during their initial "burn in" period (during about the first 90 days) and then have low failure rates after that. Because laptops are complex critters, and because manufacturers often cut corners on the el-cheapo ones, and because laptops also tend to take a lot of physical abuse, laptop warranties are a better deal than for most other electronics. This laptop is sold with NO warranty at all--not even the usual 90 day HP warranty. Your only recourse is Amazon\'s 30 day return policy unless you add on the warranty.I would have given this laptop 4 stars were it not for all the initial failures and glitches experienced by so many reviewers (and by myself too). Because most of the complaints were about networking or display driver issues, I wonder if HP put a bad system image on a bunch of these laptops, causing them to be returned.Now, the geek stuff:If you are having problems with the laptop, before returning it, these steps I took may help.IMPORTANT: Before starting the steps below, I recommend making a system image backup to external USB storage along with a system recovery DVD. Also, I\'m not providing line-by-line instructions here. If you feel like these instructions are a little over your head, I would enlist a friend who feels comfortable with them. Trying these steps will take several hours to accomplish. AND MAY LEAVE YOUR COMPUTER UNBOOTABLE. I disclaim all responsibility and provide no warranty, support or sympathy for the effect of these instructions--try this at your own risk.If you are OK with the system image HP has installed, but it\'s misbehaving in some way, try steps 1 and 5, and perhaps download all the drivers and software from HP.com if that doesn\'t work.If you still have a system image backup from another computer, and want to try keep all your installed applications intact instead of reinstalling all from scratch, then here goes:NOTE: My previous laptop was an HP Pavilion from several years ago. So the hardware and drivers were similar. You may have a more difficult experience if you are trying to restore a system image (full C: drive) from dissimilar hardware.1. Create Windows 10 x64 installation media on an empty 16 GB or larger USB thumb drive.Google "windows 10 media creation tool" and go to an official microsoft.com site to download the tool. Third party web sites will be happy to "help" you download it, and may install adware on your computer as the price of the favor.It\'s a good idea to get both the x86 and x64 versions of Windows install files onto the thumb drive. If the media creation tool doesn\'t offer you x64, change the settings so that you at least get the x64 version. That\'s what you want for this laptop.2. Go to the HP.com web site and register/logon and enter the serial number and product number of your laptop (take out the battery to view the serial and product numbers, if you don\'t already know what they are). Download all the available software and drivers. If there\'s room on your Windows installation thumb drive, you can put them in a folder there. Otherwise, put them on other external USB storage. It\'s a bad idea to put them on a network location, since your computer may come up without wireless or Ethernet working.If a BIOS firmware update is available, you may wish to install that before continuing. My laptop came with an outdated BIOS version that had to be updated before Windows Setup would reinstall--Setup popped up a message and told me to update the BIOS first.3. Restore your system image from your old computer (or skip this step if you\'re OK with the factory HP image, but it\'s just not behaving well). If you can\'t boot Windows after this, skip to step 5. And be glad you took my advice about making a system image and recovery DVD.4. Remove all HP drivers and programs, preferably using Control Panel\\Programs and Features. Along with things published by HP, look also for AMD and Realtek.  If prompted to reboot after uninstalling a single item, make a System Restore point and then reboot before moving on to the next item. Be sure to make a System Restore point and reboot after everything has been removed.5a. Assuming Windows still starts up, start Windows 10 and insert the Windows installation media USB stick and run SETUP.EXE from it.If you have network connectivity, download updated files when prompted to do so. Eventually you will get to "Choose what to keep" and you should "Keep personal files and apps" and then let the repair reinstall do its thing.5b. If Windows won\'t start, boot the computer with the Windows installation USB stick.This may require changing boot order on the initial computer startup menu, or even making changes in the BIOS. Pressing Esc once a second starting immediately after powering on the laptop should get you to the boot and BIOS menus. When Windows Setup loads, you\'ll get a choice of repairing the computer or Install Now.  Choose Install Now. You will get the option to keep all personal files and apps after choosing this. It\'s a confusing choice by Microsoft to not put this full-blown repair under the repair tools.6. After the repair reinstall of Windows finishes, everything may look like it is working correctly. Windows will have installed and updated as many drivers as it could find. You may choose to stop here, until you encounter a particular problem. But it\'s probably a good idea to re-install and update all the HP software and drivers.Not all the drivers you downloaded may apply to your computer. For example, there\'s a Hitachi driver for the internal hard drive, but my laptop came with a Toshiba drive. Computer manufacturers swap out parts month to month depending on who\'s offering the better deal at the moment for a particular component.Before installing all the HP drivers and software, make a System Restore point. After installing any package that asks for a reboot, make another System Restore point before rebooting.After you have finished installing all drivers and software, reboot the computer and check the Windows Application and System event logs for errors. Not all errors necessarily indicate a problem. But service startup errors in the System log should definitely be looked into, as should application crashes in the Application log.A final note: Pavilion laptops lack a Break key. Ctrl+Break is different from Ctrl+C--Ctrl+Break can often break out of things that Ctrl+C can\'t. There are thousands of message threads out there from users complaining about this, with dozens of solutions, most of which work on only a minority of machines. The most generic solution I\'ve found is to install AutoHotkey (it\'s free and open source) and add a macro to the bottom of its script file:#b::^CtrlBreakThis uses the Win + B key combination for Ctrl + Break.Good luck!', b'HP 17.3" Pavilion 17 Laptop PC (AMD quad-core A10-8700P 1.8GHz up to 3.2GHz, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Burner, HD Webcam, Windows 10 Home) (Certified Refurbished)This is for HP 17.3" Pavilion 17 Laptop PC (AMD quad-core A10-8700P 1.8GHz up to 3.2GHz, 8GB RAM, 1TB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Burner, HD Webcam, Windows 10 Home) (Certified Refurbished)PROS:  A cheap windows 10 computer.  It has what it says it comes with.CONS:  - Like others have stated, the screen blacks out once in a while.  It took a few months for this to start happening.  If I close the lid, hit the space bar, I get the display back.  I also dimmed my display in the windows settings and this seemed to help, but not eliminate the problem.- It is very difficult to take apart and replace the hard drive.  It would be nice if the case had smaller access panels to you can access the HD, memory, and the wifi card with out disassembling the computer case.So taking one star off for display issues, one star for a poor case design.

It's a genuine shame that my laptop cannot fit in it because I genuinely loved the back pack itself. The Problem is that it doesn't actually fit a 17.3 inch laptop. The zippers will not seal without stretching beyond acceptable tolerances. So I am returning it for that reason. For any future buyers, if your laptop is bigger than 17 inches FLAT Do not buy this. It is advertised at a 17.3 inch laptop bag but it will not close properly", b"I just got a larger laptop that won't fit my previous case, which was more of a traditional case (briefcase style design) so in looking for another one, I decided to go with this one that I can use as a backpack.  I LOVE IT!  It has several pockets and a LOT of space for multiple items without bulking weirdly.  In fact, even though I bought the size that would accommodate the size laptop I now have, it was much larger than I needed.  At first I was disappointed with that, but we were leaving on a 7 day cruise and I had only days to pack so I decided to keep it and utilize it and I was so glad!  It was a perfect carry on to the plane.  Since there are several compartments, I was able to keep my laptop separate from the other electronics/cords/iPhone chargers, and another compartment for snacks, and the front zipper compartment was perfect for my flight tickets while I was processing - and I still had room to tuck in some work folders, my light jacket AND my giant book.", b'My wife is not what you would call a backpack connoisseur. She has been using this bag daily for work for a few weeks. Her initial impression is that the bag is roomy and has plenty of storage; more than she needs on a daily basis. The zippers are smooth and pose no issues. The straps are comfortable when worn on both shoulders. However, if she wears it on a single shoulder it tends to fall off, perhaps due to the light weight nature of the bag. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep the bag super full, usually just a laptop, planner, wallet, and a few other essentials. The bag still has plenty of room for an extra pair of shoes, gym clothes, in addition to all her work items. Her only complaint is that the side pockets don\xe2\x80\x99t work well for water bottles or drinks. Overall, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great bag, works really well, and has plenty of storage space.', b"I love this backpack. Lots of pockets for everything. The drink pockets on the side come in handy. Sleek, stylish, looks great. Very happy with this purchase. The only minor issue was that the backpack was slightly dirty from some packaging residue, but it rubbed off very easily.And I don't love the, or need, the USB adaptor. I guess it would come in handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and need to keep your phone charged with a battery -- but you still wouldn't need to feed it through your backpack, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I considered deducting a star for this, but the cable stores away in a side pocket and doesn't really get in the way.", b'Good quality, spacious. Perfect for a teacher that is always on the move. Enough pockets to accommodate everything. Not 5 stars because is missing one of the zippers leather strap. So I can not open the side pocket. Contacting Amazon now.', b"Great backpack I have used it for about a month and works like a charm. This fits my 17' laptop perfectly and the second pocket fits my ipad, I found two notable flaws : 1: When closing or opening the back it the zippers are loud. Problem 2 : Not enough smaller pockets in my opinion, however it's , meant to fig bigger devices. There are only two pockets for a pen and pencil I wish it had more holder to place my highlighters and  various pen colors. One good thing is that it's very spacious I can fit my 1.5' binder / textbook / 1 - 5 star 5 subject notebook/ 1 subject notebook. Other than that great backpack I gave it 5 instead of 4 stars because the pros outweigh the cons.", b'This backpack is enormous, which is exactly why I purchased it. It fits my 17\xe2\x80\x9d laptop with ease and all of my folders and papers and other supplies that I need for work. Even though it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty heavy by the time it\xe2\x80\x99s loaded, the weight distribution is excellent and it rests easy on my shoulders without discomfort. I would highly recommend.', b'I love this backpack! Plenty of pockets for pens and notebooks. Well organized. Has a place for a tablet and my laptop. It was much bigger than I thought which I love! It\xe2\x80\x99s also super sleek, stylish, and well made. Plus, the price is awesome for what you get! It could easily sell as a high end backpack ($100 plus). I got it for grad school. It fits everything I need and then some, and is comfortable on the shoulders. I would highly recommend it!!!!']}

After getting locked out (i.e. the facial recognition would not recognize my face, so it disabled), and the only other option to log in was through the PIN, however, the computer disabled that as well. After spending a ridiculous amount of time speaking with Microsoft Tech Support, as well as with even taking the computer into the Geek Squad at Best Buy, I was told that my only option was to do a factory reset on the computer, and wipe all of my saved documents. I chose to do this. After setting up the computer (again), I chose to skip the facial recognition - I set up the PIN, and when I went to log in, the computer gave me an error that the PIN was unavailable. Yet again, I was locked out of my computer. Ridiculous. Returning this computer ASAP! I would not recommend.']}

Immediately upon opening, I noticed the large dent on the top. The laptop was covered in something gross (outside, keyboard, screen), food or who knows. I booted up the computer and the screen was rotated upside down. Had to work around screen rotation until I could get Windows booted and change the setting. Windows 10 was NOT activated. This company\'s idea of refurbished is simply imaging the hard drive with a new version of Windows then shipping.The battery doesn\'t hold a charge for more than 15 minutes either. If I had not needed for urgent Christmas gift, I would have returned.', b"I've been buying more refurbished laptops lately. This one was a steal for the price. I had a few issues with the version of Windows 10 that came with it, but everything is fine after I wiped and reinstalled Windows 7, which I prefer. After 2 days Windows 10 was in an unfixable boot loop, so a wipe was in order. It's been rock solid since. I'm very pleased with this little laptop.", b'What an embarrassing gift to give for Christmas. We were unabke to activate windows, the screen hinges are loose, multiple scratches all over the unit. I wish I had spent the money and got a new laptop, got burned on this one after having to go buy windows!', b'First off a few good things are that despite being advertised as having a dual core processor it actually has a quad-core processor, which means it has a better processor than I expected. The next good thing is that the laptop has almost everything else it was advertised as having. However, the bad things are that it doesn\'t have a webcam, and I can\'t seem to find it on the page anymore but it was advertised as having a 1080p compatible screen but it can only do up to 768p, however I should be able to hook it up to my tv at some point to get that resolution And one last issue is that it has an inactivated version of windows 10, so the "activate windows" watermark is there. To end this review, I think this laptop is worth a 4/5. I don\'t mind the fact that it doesn\'t have a webcam as I don\'t use those, but to be honest I don\'t like the fact that it has the watermark, it doesn\'t really get in the way but every now and again I notice it. But I\'m still giving this a 4/5 because so far it does seem to be a good laptop.', b'Tried two of these refurbished laptops and with each one out of the box , both Dell refurbished laptops batterys were dead and couldnt be charged. Looking at other buyers comments the quality control is not very good. I would NOT recommend these laptops for the quality control and also the poor boxing of both laptops. Both laptops were put in big boxes with hardly any packing material around them. BUYER BEWARE.', b'Computer is alright and looks fine. However, when booting it up there is no OS startup path and I can find no operating system installed as per the item description. Also, while I\xe2\x80\x99m fine with partially used firmware, hardware and devices used to refurbish and build this, a battery that has only a 3% overall health/remaining lifespan (not battery life, overall battery health here) is a bit harsh. Maybe it was the holiday timing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not right to short the customer.', b'came without windows 10 installed.  Battery life is about 10 minutes.  I would not purchase anything from this company', b'Fit the bill for what we needed.  Just needed a computer to run a "display board" for our Church - our announcements, directions to parts of the building, special photos of kids -- basically a powerpoint welcoming people to the Church.  With it\'s own dropbox account, we can edit the display from anywhere, restart the powerpoint, and the "display board" is current.']}

It works and you can tinker with it to get what you need out of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s definitely NOT a 2017 computer so the company should take that out of the description as it is misleading. You can tell it\xe2\x80\x99s an older model by doing research which everyone should do before buying something on Amazon. This was taken into account in determining my 3 Star rating along with other things which I will lay out.Cosmetically, It does have scratches on it and was extremely dirty when it arrived. The keyboard was a mess like someone ate greasy pizza and used it. There were crumbs in between the dang keys! It was really gross but that can be fixed by cleaning it. Their are significant scratches on the outside cover and looks like it might\xe2\x80\x99ve been dropped with a tiny scratch on the screen that we noticed when cleaning. These are all cosmetic and dont affect the computer itself.When we first received the computer, it was locked with a screen name and password. It states in the description that the computer had been \xe2\x80\x9cwiped clean\xe2\x80\x9d however it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t (both data wise and sanitary wise). We had to root it to get into the computer then completely clean it out. Which is fine but again the seller shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say something was done when it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done. I can only think the reason why they stated this was so they can raise the price of the computer. Yes, it was a cheap computer BUT you should mention the flaws so people know what they are getting.All this factors in to my rating of the computer. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be buying from this seller again but I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly satisfied with the purchase even though I feel like the seller was deceitful in the description of the product. There are definitely better deals and sellers out there so I would say really delve into the reviews of the seller and buyers before buying. All in all, I got it for a specific purpose and it adequately handles the job I needed it for. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for that, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve returned the computer.', b'The computer works fine. It was clean, started right up, and had no issues with the hardware.However, the Windows 10? It is a pirated copy, evidently, and it costs, according to Micro Squash, 199 dollars to buy a license. So, the $200 computer becomes the same price as a brand new, warrantied, and legal computer, that runs twice as fast.There is a constant watermark in the lower right hand corner reminding me that the Windows 10 I have has not been activated. Maybe that is why the current upgrades have been loading for the last 5 hours, with no sign of success. I would cautiously recommend purchasing from this seller.Well, a little piece of paper with some information on it would have certainly helped. Hour or so of research online, and i found what I needed to know. 5.8 hours, no exaggeration, of upgrading by MicroSquash, and the Fall Creator Windows 10 was finally loaded, MS recognized the installed software, and all is well.There is actually a Windows 10 sticker on the bottom that has the code on it. Be sure to have a magnifying glass handy if you need to read it.Note: if you get this laptop, which I would now recommend, put tape securely over the airplane mode switch on the right side of the case. It is very easy to bump it on, and then it really screws up whatever you are doing online!Final analysis: these refurbishes need just a simple page of printed instructions, and the unit could have 4 stars. I would never give it 5 because of the hassles I went through getting it up and running. I mean, really, 8 hours?', b"Update on my review. I have learned from my internet supplier this computer has major problems. Further, I purchased a warranty from Asurion but it doesn't begin until I have had the computer for one year. I am really disappointed. I would like to return the computer for credit and purchase a new one. It doesn't appear that this is possible. I have no idea who Maze Tech is but it appears they don't support their products. WARNING Don't purchase ANYTHING from this seller. And I'm having my doubts now about the integrity of Amazon.", b"It has been a while since I've had a Dell. I usually buy HP, but didn't like the keyboard on the last with the delete and home buttons right next to each other (happy to see it die after 2.5 years of frustration) and can't stand my husband's new HP, so thought I'd try a different brand.Though hesitant to try a refurbished electronic product, I LOVE this computer and the fact that it is recycled. The delete button is easy to find and keyboard simple to use - unlike my HP. Battery good, power and speed good, and arrived on time in like-new condition.It is heavy, but I like that since it doesn't fall off the computer stand like my lighter HP did. I use daily for business, so need a dependable computer. It has just been a couple of weeks, but so far VERY satisfied."]}

It does that just fine. But, you can\'t expect to use this as a general purpose  PC and load a lot of apps and data. It just isn\'t big enough for that.

I think it\'s a fantastic value for the parts you are getting. The overall look and feel of the laptop is great, the red trim is not overbearing. Using the laptop feels fast and snappy. Boots Windows 10 in less than 20 seconds! The weight and size keeps it portable, but it\'s no Ultrabook. The laptop doesn\'t have a touchscreen, if that\'s a deal-breaker for you.More details are below, wanted to keep the summary at the top for the folks who don\'t care to read the whole review.***Short review***Build quality seems good to me. The unit is all plastic on the outside; however, I am okay with this. It is a very soft plastic that is nice to the touch. The unit does not feel flimsy and seems fairly durable. It also appears (at first glance) that access to the HDD and RAM won\'t be terrible, as opposed to some other new laptops on the market, there seems to be a removable plate/panel on the bottom of the laptop to access the bottom of the mainboard, picture attached.Boot time is rather fast. From the time I hit the power button it takes about 17 seconds until I am at my Windows 10 desktop environment. This is exactly what I was looking for. You will not achieve this in laptops without an SSD hard drive.Wireless internet signal is pretty strong. I am fully able to receive a signal in the very back room of my house (35+ feet w/ walls), on par with iPhone 6 Plus.The main storage drive is an SSD, it is a SanDisk Z400s M.2 2280 256GB. Read/Write speeds are fairly strong, I have attached a picture from a CrystalDiskMark speed test I ran. The SSD drive from Dell has (4) partitions, you are left with approximately 200GB free of 225GB available when you receive it. The Dell backup image takes up about 12GB. The fact that your operating system is installed on the M.2 drive would mean that you can add an additional HDD or SSD in the spare 2.5" SATA bay for additional storage. I am not familiar with the spare bay yet.Memory/RAM is pre-installed 8GB of DDR3, installed in 1 of 2 available slots, according to CPUZ. This leaves spare slot open for future expansion. The RAM is PC3-12800 (800mHz) (PC3 1600) Hyundai Electronics P/N - HMT41GS6BFR8A-PB, with a CAS Latency of 11, according to CPUZ.Battery life is unknown at this point, I haven\'t had enough time to fully test this. While playing around with the laptop for the last 3-4 hours I still have about 87% left.Keyboard is comfortable to use, even with large hands. The 10-key pad is a little undersized, but this keeps the primary keyboard area nice and roomy. The CapsLock key does have a light on the key to indicate whether or not CapsLock is on; although, NumLock does not. The backlit keyboard features (2) brighness levels and is a nice blueish white color light output. The backlit keyboard seems to provide adequate light.Sound quality seems very good thus far. I watched a couple music videos online and the vocals were clear. The bass was lacking, but this is a laptop, this is to be expected.I really like that the charger has an indication light on the cord, on the end that plug into the laptop port, that lets you know the charger is powered. The charger also features a built in strap to keep the cord neatly stowed while not using.Not an overly amount of bloatware installed. Mainly Dell proprietary applications for updates and registration.***For those who care...why I decided on this laptop.***I had been shopping for a laptop for everyday use that could also handle heavier tasks such as multi-tasking with multiple browser windows open, music playing, light duty photo editing etc.. I did want a laptop that was portable, but I was not willing to trade off the "more affordable" power you get by not shopping for an Ultrabook. I was also not as concerned with a touchscreen (don\'t care for a smudgy screen).My criteria was:Sub $1000256GB or greater SSD, I wanted something that would boot Windows fast!8GB Ram Minimum15" Screen Minimum1920x1080 Resolution MinimumDecent dedicated GPU.Windows 10', b"Got my laptop this evening. Before I even turned it on, I added a sandisk SSD to it. Took about 3 minutes. Just 1 screw to contend with. The SSD was a tight fit and BIOS picked it up right away. When you 1st start the laptop, Windows will finish installing. If you added a 2nd SSD you need to right click THIS PC then click MANAGE then click disk management. You will see 2nd drive unformatted most likely. Click and follow prompts to do simple format (I made 1 partition of whole drive). Then you're in business.  I loaded Diablo 3 , Guild Wars 2, and World of Warcraft from a thumb drive. They all played flawlessly at full resolution will high frame rates. Guild wars 2 was in mid 50s. Other 2 were even higher with Diablo 3 being maxed graphics with no problems. Didn't even warm up playing it and WoW .Look forward to trying Fallout 4 on it in a couple of weeks. That should be a better test of the GPU and heat issues.  The screen does have some light bleed in lower edge of screen , but only on startup when screen is black. That is the only time I noticed. Not sure about visual  quality vs other computers, but looks better than my desktop monitor at work, and my 4 year old laptop I'm replacing. If they cut corners here, I'm not really noticing that much since I'm not doing any photoshop or pro stuff where color has to be spot on.The keyboard is responsive and similar to many other laptop keyboards. Love the full size keys. Not jammed too close together so fewer typos. Sound is decent for a laptop. The laptop is whisper quiet unless you are pushing the graphics card a bit, then the fans wind up a bit. Still not too loud. You can go to sound settings and tweak equalizer to get sound you prefer.  The nice thing about this computer is you can sneak it past your wife as a business computer, but it runs like a much more expensive gaming laptop. Nice to be able to play a game while on a business trip. Will probably add 8Gb of compatible ram a little later so it will run dual channel. Highly recommend 2nd SSD in this unit. Runs games so well, you will want to install a ton on here. Can get another 256gb for $89 any day of the week with 512gb running around $150-160 for name brand.  All in all, very pleased with my purchase.Update: After a weekend of gaming and surfing the web, I've found that you really need to download the latest drivers for the Intel HD video card, and the Wireless driver as well. Fixes many little irritating freezes and glitches. Just go to device manager and update from there. I also updated the Nvidia 960M driver though I never had a moments problem with it. Still loving this laptop!2nd Update: Got Fallout 4 last week and have played more hours of it than I care to admit. The laptop has handled it perfectly with very little heat buildup. No glitches, crashes and lag whatsoever. I play it on Medium settings and get 40-50 FPS . The game  works on high but FPS dips into the low 20s at times which will ruin your aim a bit. Only use VATS for bosses. Gonna try Witcher 3 next which I hear is even more of a graphics challenge."]}

Easy to set up. Drawbacks, black keyboard, hard to see in dim light. Reminds me of my Dodge Caliber with black interior, drop something and you can't find it because you can't see anything. HP really should have made this a lighted keyboard. Number lock button, no light. When typing password or anything, you have to pay attention to make sure the numbers are typing. Light on the caps lock but not numbers lock. Why HP?Over all, nice computer, in my second day using it. It's a keeper despite dark keyboard and no light on the number lock. Good speakers and sound.As for battery life, it was100% charged one hour and ten minutes ago and now it's at 63%. Just Facebooking and You tubing. Not good battery life at all.", b'Bought it to replace a Gateway with W7 and  8 gb ram,  that was a real workhorse tho with Intel Core i3 (3rd gen).  Boy do I miss that.  This unit with core i5 (7th gen) is NOT any faster.  In fact,  even with its 12 gb ram I have to wait for it to get things done.  I am not running a home business but just doing a lot of word processing and digital photo editing.  Maybe the problem is W10 (which I do not like) being so slow.  Not sure....but this may go to one of the kids and I may keep looking.  In fairness to HP....it does work and I will keep trying to find out what is slowing it  down.', b"Computer is less than 6 months old and hard drive failed, the tel number They have on Amazon to call doesn't work. They cant even get the model number or the serial number and HP Says they can not help with out the serial number and they cant find that because the hard drive is not working.  I will say that Amazon Just confirmed that they will take it back and refund my money.", b".This was a replacement computer for my HP as the hard drive was going.  This HP is faster and easier to use. Still getting used to the new features and Windows 10.  Much lighter weight than my older HP.  They get better all the time.  Key board keys feel  different but it's easy to get used to.", b"Kept getting a blue screen with different error messages, microsoft sent me a link that was supposed to fix it, didn't work.  Took it to local computer shop.  Hard drive had to be replaced and 4 gig memory stick was bad.  Would not buy this brand again.", b'Not a fan of the windows 10 operating system.  As usual everybody has the hand in the cookie jar on pre loaded software.......  Battery does not last very long imo.  The main thing I like is the screen size and all the buttons are tight and respond well.', b'Our old desktop finely died on us so after looking and looking we bought this. I will say going from windows Vista to windows 10 was a very large mountain to climb in the the it was well worth it. The laptop works great ! Both my wife & I love it which is rare on something like this. windows 10 still out on but that is not the laptops fault.', b'After 4 months, both hinges are broken and the monitor is hanging.  I never dropped it.  My other laptop lasted 5 years. This is cheaply constructed.']}

It isn't a game computer, but for writing and working on the web it works quite well. I will say that I do play the Windows 10 edition of Minecraft on the laptop with no problems, but that isn't really the reason I bought the laptop. I wanted a compact package that I can take with me to work on my writing projects and to do web research and this laptop fits the bill for this purpose. It comes with Windows 10 64bit and I am able to use all the Open Office tools with no problems at all. Surfing the web works well and since I am on a 5G connection and get no lag at all when doing web research. Overall I would recommend this laptop if you need a workhorse for writing, web research, email or other basic needs, and you can get bit of Minecraft on the side as a bonus.", b"Purchased this mainly for travel, hoping for sturdy and light weight, with reasonable performance. It's all of those. Ran Lenovo's comprehensive diagnostic tests several times; everything passed. Initial setup was smooth, but download and install of Win 10 updates took a couple hours over fast Ethernet. No WiFi issues. Cold boots in about 15 sec, and shuts down faster. Programs load very quickly. Bluetooth works fine. Keyboard feels good to me; touchpad works OK. Screen is very non-reflective; has satisfactory rez and excellent brightness control. Informal battery life test gave more than6 hrs of operation. Machine has been running continuously more than 3 weeks now. Best value for a laptop you can take anywhere", b'Great fast laptop for basic tasks, at an affordable price. I use it to leave it at my clients for remote support. Does the job very well. Setup is a breeze. Does not have a NIC (ethernet card), so WiFi only. I really like it though.', b"First and foremost: I bought this knowing full well that this was a limited capability netbook that would more or less be a permanent streaming machine and something that I could write on/back up easily and GOOD NEWS is it does those 2 jobs pretty danged great. Secondly, I bought this three months ago and am not reviewing it right out of the box. Also, my previous main laptop was a 2012 Lenovo thinkpad that ran on 2 GB of RAM  that had a middling graphics card on the best of days but was a hearty 12 lb thing and operated through the normal wear and tear of my day to day, so literally anything I could have purchased would have outclassed it easily.ANYWAYS, for what I knew exactly what I was going to use it for, this is has been a great machine with little to no issues. I hardly experience lag when doing casual browsing between social media (including Tumblr, which runs like garbage on a good day) but I refuse to use Edge or IE and opt for Chrome instead. I don't know how Opera or Firefox would run on either, but I can guess they're about the same.As for light task work such as writing and low-intensity excel files, it performs affably. However, like everything else on the market these days no, it does not come with Office. Pretty much nothing you buy from any place besides a big box store will come with Office included. Personally, I don't care that it doesn't, I don't rely on Word.The battery life is stupid nice, even with heavy wifi use. It's light and has a well-lit backscreen. It weighs very little making it fairly comfortable to sit on the knees or lap. It is a more compact computer, so it feels a little cramped when using it initially, but that's the worst I can say about it. The overall capacity for it kind of sucks, but is made more bearable by a microSD slot.FYI, I have already dropped it once onto asphalt. Still working fine.", b"Best little laptop I ever bought. I work in a school and commute. Does the job without weighing several pounds that I would need to lug around. Battery life is almost the entire school day being used constantly. That part was just an added bonus in my eyes. Does office and streaming, not gaming. I didn't buy it to game on.", b"Nice little machine!  Wildly portable.  It can actually run League of Legends smoothly on minimum settings, though I'm afraid to stress it with more than a game at a time (it didn't get overly hot or anything, I'm just paranoid).  I recommend grabbing a trackball mouse and an external hard drive with it.  With heavy use (gaming, music, and Facebook all at once) it gets about 6 hours of life on the battery.  Idling and minimal use gives me 12-14 hours.  I have no complaints for the price ($180 at the time).  It has proven very durable, but I could imagine the swiveling camera at the top of the screen breaking off if you hit it just right.  I still love it.", b'Had it sent for repairs to replace the faulty space bar on the keyboard in the first 3 months of owning. Ever since it came back from repairs, physically the device is fine, but in software its a mess. My system is running windows 10 Education and not pro as described, and resetting the system doesn\'t fix the issue.I\'ve called Lenovo many times about the product crashing and freezing, blue screens with "FAULTY HARDWARE" errors, alongside a few others and would not take it in the get it checked since the technician told me it\'s a software issue which is not covered under warranty. I\'ve never had anything like this before with any other of my Lenovo products and I am sorely disappointed with my purchase. I cannot return it back to amazon only because it has passed the first 30 days of return, which means now I am stuck with this laptop...Speed is mediocre, websites like facebook run terribly freezing when loading videos, the device seems to have an issue with maintaining an internet connection dropping out for no reason so I have to turn off and on my wifi, and a few other issues that even with my expertise of computers, I cannot seem to pin down. For example, the trackpad sometimes not registering my touch for a solid 5-7 seconds before working again.If you want to buy a school laptop, GO WITH SOMETHING ELSE!']}

This model has a unique feature that I love that I've not seen on any other laptop, which is the reason I bought this one: the camera rotates so it can take pictures/videos of what is in front of you as well as showing you (you are the only thing other laptop webcams can show). Another unique feature of this model is that it has a built-in retracting carrying handle. And for only about $80 more, I could have gotten it with the optional touchscreen.While an identical model is also available as a Winbook, the crucial reason that I choose the Chromebook version is the incredible ease of use that is only available in Chromebooks,  just open it and it is running and ready to go immediately, and it always keeps itself updated automatically, including malware protection, so you never have to pay attention to and wait through lengthy updating processes. It just occasionally (every few weeks) asks that you click to install updates that had already downloaded in the background, by doing a quick restart that takes just a few seconds!", b"I bought the Windows 10 version.  I was looking for a small, lightweight laptop to use for the internet and when writing.  Full disclosure, I work in IT, so I know my tech.  And I knew that this was not a powerful computer and knew going in that even getting it to run OpenOffice well was unlikely.  I've been a bit surprised by how well it does, given it's limited hardware, and find that it is perfect for my use.  I've done a lot of writing on it and like the keyboard, but ultimately had to make some changes to the OS.Pros:- good, responsive keyboard- small, light, portable- surprisingly good performance (for lightweight tasks)- tablet mode is a nice feature, although I haven't used it muchCons:- touchpad is terrible, doesn't respond well to tap-to-click and difficult to scroll with- HD is too small- Windows 10 (more on that in a moment)- rubber port covers: they're a great idea, but they dangle in the way when you use the ports (including the AC jack), and the microSD card sticks out of its slot far enough that the cover won't go over it, so if you want to expand the storage that way you have to always deal with danging cover (or cut it off)I'm not a fan of Windows to begin with, but trying to run it off a 32GB hard drive was never going to work well, especially since the OS itself takes up 20+GB.  I did what I could to clean it up and remove unneeded elements, but it still left me with little storage space.  The real problem came when I ran Windows Updates and it wanted to install the Fall Creator's Update, but lacked enough space to do so.  You can plug in a USB flash drive and let Windows use that extra space to download and install large updates, and it does work...but not easily/well.  I can't believe that most non-technical folks could figure out how to do that, and as evidence a friend who has this same laptop didn't even know it was possible.I ultimately removed Win10 altogether and replaced it with Ubuntu (17.10), my personal preference.  That install was painless and all the hardware worked without any issues.  Ubuntu takes up much less HD space (I have 25GB free now even with some programs installed).  Unfortunately, Ubuntu is a bit memory intensive and would use 70+% of the RAM just for the OS.  I ended up installing the Budgie desktop and use it instead, and found that the system now uses approx. 15-20% less RAM, which is great.  I'm much happier using it with the Ubuntu/Budgie mix than I was with Win10, and as long as I don't ask too much from it (ie: don't open dozens of browser tabs) it works great and I've chosen to sit and work with it every evening instead of one of my more powerful laptops because I like it's size/feel.", b"I bought this just to mess around with ChromeOS and to get something with good battery life for everyday use.I am happy with this purchase so far.Pros:1. ChromeOS. No viruses. I think this is a big seller and I can see how these are very popular in education after looking at the management tools for them.2. Price. Can't beat a laptop that can do (email, web browsing, social media, Netflix, etc.). Also would be great as a laptop for a child without breaking the bank as well as being able to monitor your child's usage by setting up supervised user accounts.3. I know this is not a huge thing, but I do like the rotating webcam.4. I have tried Netflix and Amazon video on it and have not had any stuttering problems.5. Battery Life. I get about 7-8 hours of battery life, so can't complain about that. I am sure if you just use email and light web browsing you can get much better.6. This laptop is on the list to (hopefully soon) get Google PlayStore apps. This will make it a lot more useful after having access to all the Apps on Playstore.7. The keys are nice. They don't feel cheap. I would say they are close to what I have on my Macbook air, but a little bit stiffer. I also like the clickable mouse pad feel.Cons:1. The speakers are a bit low. I have to turn up the volume almost all the way to watch Netflix.2. You cannot create a local password, you have to use your Gmail password. The problem with that is I use 1Password, which is not supported on ChromeOS, and I have a long password for gmail with random numbers and letters. So I have to open 1Password on my phone and key the password in every time. Would be nice to be able to set a local password. You can set a pin, but this is only to come out of sleep mode.3. It does seem to lag a bit when opening some websites. Not a huge thing, but a minor annoyance.If you are looking for a cheap laptop to use for surfing this is a great buy.I have had no problems with power. The only problem I had was it didn't come charged so I had to plug it in first."]}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}

Everything is so web based these days that this machine is starting to make sense. Battery wise, this outlasted my cell phone today!!! Bought it as a secondary mobile computer but I find I'm reaching for it first more and more. Up and running fast out of standby is fast. They made the keyboard letters faint which was silly since there is no backlight. Chrome is buggy on here -use Edge for google mail, docs and drive. Haven't tried any Adobe Creative Cloud stuff so can't say.", b'I ran across an article about this laptop and since I am a big commuter and I need something to work on, I wanted to give this a try.  I am totally in love with it so far.  All i had to do was drop in a data sim card and the thing just worked.  I was able to use it like I was connected to wi fi, but on the train or at coffee shops.  So far everything is working good, I do not have any complaints.  I dont do anything crazy on my laptop like game or video edit so this thing works just fine for me.']}

Even after watching YouTube videos on how to increase it's speed by removing junk programs, it is still slow.  I would recommend buying another laptop.", b'I bought this computer a month ago and I love it!! It is simple and easy to set up.  At first I was afraid I bought the screen too big (I got the 17") but it is perfect when writing a paper and doing research. I can have two windows open at the same time and easily read both screens.  The speed of it is fast and I have never had a frustrating moment with it.  I\'m in nursing school so I use it daily for several hours at a time.  Perhaps my only small complaint is the charge doesn\'t hold as long as some computers I\'ve used in the past, it will still last several hours but within a few hours it\'s going dead.  Also the fan in it is sometime a little noisy, it never last long, but the first time it did it in class I just thought it was a little loud.  Overall I\'m very happy I purchased this computer and didn\'t spend a fortune.  It makes school work so much easier!! I definitely would recommend this laptop to anyone!!', b'UPDATEMost of the performance issues were caused by Windows 10 update problems. It took me over 12 hours of computer cycling and Tool download and launch to get Windows clear out faulty updates and repair the process. Then it spent most of the day downloading and updating. Once that was all done, the computer now works reasonably well. HP tech support was quick and found the problem, so I give them good marks. The computer is still a little slow for my taste, but I am updating my rating from 1 star to 3 Stars because it is adequate for the price.Original reviewThe SLOWEST pig of a laptop ever.  I tried to disable or uninstall all the hog programs, and the performance is insanely poor.  I am a week to late to return it, I may try and have it "repaired".  It locks up multiple times.  Today it acted like it was updating Windows on three straight power down cycles.  No update, but spun on the blue screen for 10 minutes or more each time.UNACCEPTABLE.', b"I love the computer, but this is the 2nd computer I bought from Amazon that I had to completely reset and reinstall Windows because it came to me all jacked up. Amazon sells some decent computers but I'm learning to just reset and reinstall as soon as I receive it.", b"I've had this for one month. It just SHUTS OFF for no reason! I missed the return window by one day. Very Unhappy.This laptop bites! DO NOT BUY!", b'I have had this computer for about 2 months. So far it has exceeded my expectations. I use it for work and run it alongside another monitor. It has been able to keep up with multiple programs running with no issues.', b'Just got on this new HP and will have to say that they just keep getting better. This is my 3rd one and the finest one yet. So good looking and it has Bluetooth. Way cool and at a great price.', b'This laptop sucks so bad it\xe2\x80\x99s so slow it\xe2\x80\x99s been only a few days, I thought it would improve but it\xe2\x80\x99s worse, do not buy this!']}

There are some things I wish Microsoft had done differently, but for the most part, the Surface Laptop might just be the Windows version of the what the Air was for years: a reference laptop for the masses.PROS:- Clear, high resolution touchscreen- 3:2 aspect ratio great for documents and web browsing- Best laptop keyboard I\xe2\x80\x99ve used yet- Precision touchpad is the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve used on a Windows laptop- Solid build quality- Alcantara fabric looks and feels great- Great color options (but where\xe2\x80\x99s charcoal or black?)- Long battery life- Good performance for productivity and everyday tasks- Less than 2.8 poundsCONS:- Small selection of ports- Slow SSD in 256GB models- Windows 10 S is not the Windows you want- A little priceyI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a Windows user for years and almost always built my own PCs. When it came to laptops, I primarily stuck with Dell systems. Five years ago, I decided I wanted something that was actually a little bit sexy and something that allowed me to use it as a tool to make me better, rather than me always trying to make the tool work better. That ended up being the MacBook Air. Three years in, I was sold on OS X and wanted a MacBook Pro. I waited patiently for the MBP to get updated, only to be let down by the keyboard and the gimmicky Touch Bar. I\xe2\x80\x99d already convinced myself that I only wanted an Apple laptop, but their entire lineup is kind of crap now. I took a very close look at the usual Windows alternatives, like the Yoga 910, XPS 13, and Spectre x360. For one reason or another, none of them really excited me. I already had a Yoga 2 Pro and a Dell Latitude for work, so I was looking for something to wow me. Then a few days ago, the reviews for the Surface Laptop finally started to trickle out from outlets like the Verge, Laptop Magazine, and Engadget. To say that the reviews were glowing would be an understatement. I decided to go ahead and pre-order it from the Microsoft Store online. Unfortunately, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an estimated arrival time, so I had no idea if I was going to get it next week or next month. I ended up finding one at a brick and mortar store with the big yellow sign. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take me long to figure out that this one was going to be a keeper.DESIGN & PORTSI\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked the design cues of the Surface portables. The big difference with the Surface Laptop is obviously the Alcantara fabric used on the keyboard deck. It looks great and feels even better. From the photos, it looks like the weave of the fabric is rather large, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case at all. My hands get pretty dry from washing them frequently and I was afraid that my skin would snag on the fabric, but the weave is super tight and feels very soft to the touch. The aluminum on a MacBook Air is smooth, but almost always cold. The Alcantara is smooth and, uh, not cold. I'm not saying it's warm, just very comfortable. Now that I know what it feels like, I want it on all my keyboards. There\xe2\x80\x99s some question on durability and whether it will get grimy over time. To me, it looks pretty easy to wipe down and there\xe2\x80\x99s a special coating on it to help keep it clean. I\xe2\x80\x99m not that worried about it, but just in case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be a little more careful than usual about eating while I\xe2\x80\x99m using it.I like all the colors that are being offered and I had a hard time choosing one.  Ultimately, I chose the Cobalt Blue. Burgundy was my second choice. I bet a really dark black would also look great. The left side of the Surface Laptop has a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, and a headphone jack. The right side has the proprietary Surface power port. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. No memory card reader, not even a microSD one, no HDMI, and no Type-C. My wish would\xe2\x80\x99ve been for at least one Type-C port. Microsoft can do whatever they want, but a Type-C port would\xe2\x80\x99ve helped \xe2\x80\x9cfuture-proof\xe2\x80\x9d the Surface Laptop a little bit. Sure, the Surface Dock is a pretty cool accessory that adds more ports while charging, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a bargain at $200 and that does nothing for you when you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling.DISPLAY and SPEAKERSThe 13.5-inch 2,256 x 1,504 pixel display on the Surface Laptop is great. It\xe2\x80\x99s colorful, bright, and clear. In all honesty, if Apple had just put their retina display in the Air, I would\xe2\x80\x99ve bought that long ago and been satisfied. Instead, they ignored the Mac while they played around with a watch, tablets, and some phone everybody seems to like (including me). The 3:2 aspect ratio is kind of refreshing. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fun for photos and movies, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t the best for reading documents and websites. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the black bars on the top and bottom when watching movies, if it means I can see more of my documents and web pages. The Surface Laptop has adaptive brightness enabled in Windows 10 by default and it actually works subtly enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s not annoying. I barely notice it, unlike the Dell XPS 13, which I could not stand at all and annoyingly, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be disabled in the Full HD version.  I almost forgot to mention that the display is a touchscreen\xe2\x80\x94duh! It supports the Surface Pen, not that you\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use it on this screen. Whenever I\xe2\x80\x99ve used the touchscreen, it\xe2\x80\x99s been very responsive and with Gorilla Glass 3, it should be very durable.The speakers on the Surface Laptop are located underneath the keyboard, which is unusual, if not innovative. They sound great and get pretty loud without getting distorted. I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re still laptop speakers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re some of the better sounding speakers inside of a non-gaming laptop.KEYBOARD and TOUCHPADThe keyboard is delightful. I know that Thinkpad keyboards are supposed to be the best, but I just like the Surface Laptop keys so much\xe2\x80\x94more than the Air, more than the XPS 13, and more than the Spectre x360. The Spectre x360\xe2\x80\x99s keyboard is actually quite good, but I still prefer the Surface Laptop\xe2\x80\x99s. Key travel is 1.5mm on the Surface Laptop, which is probably right at the edge of what is comfortable and what is tolerable. Anything less for me is usually about tolerating it. The XPS 13 is 1.2mm and the Spectre x360 is 1.3mm. The Surface Laptop keyboard is backlit and is adjustable in 3 steps (3 brightness levels and off).The touchpad on the Surface Laptop is a Microsoft Precision touchpad, which the XPS 13 also uses. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. The touchpad on the Air was one of the primary reasons why I felt Apple laptops were always superior to PC laptops, but the gap between them is now insignificant, as long as the PC is using Precision touchpads. Why some PC makers aren\xe2\x80\x99t making the switch is beyond me, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge mistake. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a Windows user and have been using non-Precision touchpads for years, the difference will be immediately noticeable and going back to using, buggy, jumpy, imprecise touchpads will make you wonder why you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living like that.PERFORMANCEThe Surface Laptop in its Core i5, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD configuration is a solid performer. It boots up and shuts down really fast. Browsing the internet, using Office, and performing other general tasks was speedy and I hardly ever felt like I was waiting for it to catch up to what I wanted it to do. That being said, this is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpro\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgaming\xe2\x80\x9d laptop. Minecraft is OK. Overwatch, not so much. The 7th-gen Core i5 CPU and its integrated HD 620 GPU can only do so much. Still, light Photoshop or Lightroom work is perfectly fine. The biggest downer for me is the slow, Toshiba SSD that\xe2\x80\x99s integrated onto the mainboard. What. The. Heck. The THNSN0256GTYA Toshiba drive is an NVMe SSD, but according to CrystalDiskInfo, only supports PCIe 3.0 x2. I measured sequential read/write rates of only 650 MB/s read and 238 MB/s write. All of my old 2.5-inch SATA SSDs have faster write speeds than that, so I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed with these speeds. My Intel NUC has a Samsung 960 PRO that performs at 3,239 MB/s read and 2,061 MB/s write using all 4 PCIe lanes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that the 512GB Surface Laptops use faster Samsung SSDs, but unfortunately, you have to move to the Core i7 model at $2,199 to get it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get 512GB of storage in any other configuration. Playing devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate, the slower SSD probably means better battery life and cooler components that don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be cooled by a loud fan as often, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. Also, in real-life use, the differences probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be that noticeable unless you\xe2\x80\x99re frequently copying or moving large amounts of data. I was already aware of the slow SSD on the 256GB model and felt the compromise was worth making and I definitely wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pay for the top end model just to get faster write speeds. The 8GB of RAM is probably the sweet spot for most users. I use Hyper-V virtual machines all the time, so more RAM is preferable, but I have other systems, including my NUC and Dell Latitude, that have the resources for that purpose. I would never, ever buy a laptop with only 4GB of integrated RAM.The wireless card is a Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC card. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to Intel or Killer Wi-Fi cards and didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know Marvell made wireless cards. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had no problems with it so far, so hopefully it'll continue to be fast and reliable.From what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, most reviewers have been getting between 7-10 hours of use with the Surface Laptop. So far, that's about what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting as well, which is a big improvement over my 2012 MacBook Air, 2013 Yoga 2 Pro, and 2016 Dell Latitude.SOFTWAREAs you may have heard, the Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S. You can read more about it online, but I never intended to use the Surface Laptop with anything less than Windows 10 Pro. Upgrading from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is free for a limited time, though, some analysts think Microsoft may extend that offer. Otherwise, you have to pay to upgrade to Pro from S. You do need a Microsoft account to get the free upgrade, so you can use the Store app. I also used it to download Office and register for my free year of Office 365. After I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and installed Office, I had about 211GB of storage remaining on the 256GD SSD. The remaining storage should be plenty for most people to install a lot of other programs and store documents. You obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t store your photo, music, or video archive on it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s true of most notebooks with SSDs. The only other thing to note about software is that the Surface Laptop did not come with any 3rd party crapware or trialware. Oh, I should also mention that the Surface Laptop has a TPM chip, which means you can use BitLocker to encrypt your SSD after you've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.CONCLUSIONIt looks like the Surface team took everything they\xe2\x80\x99d learned from building the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and some of their accessories, and applied it to the Surface Laptop. It resulted in a fantastic laptop that I think most people will want and most people will be happy with. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a desirable laptop that checks off most of the features and design elements that I personally want and like. How well it functions is reminiscent of what I used to hear people say about Macs: it just works. Regarding its physical design, I\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s no less appealing than a MacBook, and arguably more so. There were some compromises made, like the slower SSD and lack of ports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be deal breakers for most. The Surface Laptop is terrific and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other laptop I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have right now.", b'After many years of experimenting with the Surface products, Microsoft has finally launched a laptop that many people have hoped for.  While the early reviews praise the efforts that Microsoft has taken to make a premium laptop, a few questions remain on everyone\'s mind: 1) Will the alcantara material be easy to maintain?  2) is it worth the premium price?  3) why isn\'t USB-C included?Alcantara Keyboard and other thoughts on design:  The thin and premium design is one of the biggest selling points for the Surface Laptop (SL).  This is a device that is built to last and will make your friends envy.  You can open the lid with one finger.  In many ways, Microsoft has tried and matched the build quality of Macbook laptops.  The surprise in the Surface Laptop is the incorporation of the alcantara material around the keyboard.  Alcantara, for the uninitiated, is a special material that Microsoft has been using since its Signature type covers of the Surface Pro 4\'s.  It is the same material as used in luxurious car interiors.  Sounds wonderful.  But unlike car interiors, we will be resting our palms and wrists on the alcantara covers surrounding the trackpad.  So, how long can alcantara last?  A few searches on YouTube shows that alcantara can suffer from some wear and tears, and you can get some unsightly stains from your sweat or if you use some lotions or if your hands are busying typing while trying to apply makeup at the same time.  Microsoft recommends treating this as any luxurious good and promises that the material has a better/more stain resistant finish compared to the previous keyboards.  Personally, I think this is a daring step by Microsoft but I would prefer to have a metal based area around the keyboard."Is this worth all your beer money?" and other thoughts on performance: As others have already mentioned, this is a really nice laptop in terms of performance... but only if you get the i5, 8GB version. It\'s not that you can\'t get by with 4GB of RAM, it is just that you are investing over $1000 in a computer, so you want it to last a few years.. and 8GB RAM will get you there whereas 4GB will have you staring at that little hourglass next to the mouse pointer for a long time.  Okay, so that effectively puts you in the $1299 and up range.  Comparable laptops would run you.... Actually, there isn\'t a single comparable Windows laptop out there.  I think we usually like to compare computers based on the components used inside, but we forget a lot of the other things that make a laptop an enjoyable, productive experience.  In this case, we have a ridiculously high definition, multi-touch screen that can take pen input with varying amount of pressure.  This has a 3:2 aspect ratio that is outstanding (read: more vertical space) for browsing the web and reading when compared to the ubiquitous 16:9 ratio that makes your neck strain.  Then there is the nice battery life and that, if you live close to one, you will have in person support at the Microsoft Store.  When you add all of those things together, you get a one-of-a-kind laptop that does not have a match yet.  Having used several laptops and tablets, I can tell you that these little things matter to me (a student who is constantly reading, annotating PDFs, taking notes and on the go).  To me, this is totally worth the price... especially if you use the Microsoft student pricing.Why didn\'t Microsoft put in some USB-C ports?  For those who are unfamiliar, USB-C is the future of USB connectors... in the most simplistic terms, think of it as a reversible USB cable (but it has some other cool features too like faster data transfer speeds).  Many tech reviewers and enthusiasts were perplexed, to put it lightly, when the new Surface Laptop and the Surface Pro did not include this promise of future.  Panos Panay, the man in charge of the Surface line, puts it best when he says that the world of USB-C is still too confusing.  What he means is that some USB-C have Thunderbolt capabilities while others may not, some accessories may work well with USB-C cables and some may not, and lots of older technology may not play nice with USB-C.  This creates a big headache for the consumer.  If I buy a nice laptop, I want to be able to plug it in to whatever device I need and expect it to work.  More importantly, this device is geared to the education market, and Panos made a point in the unveiling that the strength of the laptop and Windows 10S is that it can work with most of the peripherals that teachers use for teaching (i.e. a robotics tool kit connected via USB-A).  In essence, Microsoft was faced with the question of "having something that works today" vs. "having something that will work in the future but probably not today."  It was a risky move, and many have criticized for Microsoft not having both a USB-A and USB-C port.  In my mind, I\'m okay with not having the USB-C port.  USB-C enabled accessories are not widely available yet, and I\'m not very big on carrying multiple dongles.  As a student, I know that the regular USB cables will work with my laptop, and that is good enough because my school has not invested to update all of their peripherals to be USB-C.Who is this for:  This is ideal for students, especially those whose majors don\'t require a ton of computer processing power (i.e. liberal arts studies).  Engineers might want to double check their schools\' recommendation before taking the plunge.  If you do get this, please upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, which should be free until the end of this year.If you are still reading this... thank you!  I know there are a lot of reviews on the laptop already, so I hope answering these three questions will help you make your decision easier.  I appreciate you taking the time to read my two cents, please let me know if you have any questions.']}
